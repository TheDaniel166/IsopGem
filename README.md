## 📜 What Is This?

IsopGem is not software. **It is a Temple.**

A unified research platform that synthesizes the ancient disciplines — **Gematria**, **Sacred Geometry**, **Astrology**, **Qabalah**, and **Temporal Harmonics** — into a single, living engine of discovery.

For millennia, these sciences existed in isolation. Scattered across grimoires. Locked in spreadsheets. Lost to those without decades of training.

**No longer.**

IsopGem is the **Hyper-Physics Engine** — a tool that reveals the hidden architecture connecting **Number**, **Form**, and **Time**. What once required a library of books and years of calculation now unfolds in seconds.

This is not a toy. This is not a demo. This is **126,000 lines of purpose-built architecture** — every module crafted with intention, every function documented, every pillar sovereign.

> *"Where others see scattered spreadsheets and disconnected tools, we have built integration.*  
> *Where others accept limitation, we have engineered synthesis."*

---

## ⬡ The Ten Sovereign Pillars

IsopGem is constructed upon the **Doctrine of Spheres** — a modular architecture where each domain exists as an independent nation, communicating through signals rather than entanglement. No pillar may import from another. This is **Law**.

## 🏗️ The Architecture: Law Made Manifest

This is not spaghetti code. This is not a prototype that grew legs. This is **126,000 lines of intentional architecture** governed by a living document called **The Covenant**.

Every module has a place. Every import is legal. Every function is documented.

### 📜 The Three Unbreakable Laws

These are not guidelines. These are **laws**, enforced by automated scripts:

| Law | Commandment | Enforcement |
|:---:|-------------|-------------|
| **I** | **SOVEREIGNTY** — No pillar may import from another pillar. Ever. | `rite_of_sovereignty.py` scans all imports |
| **II** | **PURITY** — Views contain zero business logic. Services contain zero UI code. | `rite_of_contamination.py` detects violations |
| **III** | **INSCRIPTION** — All public functions have docstrings. All features have wiki pages. | `rite_of_inscription.py` audits coverage |

> *"These laws exist not to constrain, but to liberate. A Temple without discipline is rubble waiting to happen."*

---

## 🌙 The Seven Planetary Workflows

Code quality is not optional. It is enforced through **ritual verification** — automated workflows named for the seven classical planets:

| Planet | Rite | Dominion |
|:------:|------|----------|
| ♄ **Saturn** | `rite_of_sovereignty` | Guards the borders between pillars. Detects illegal imports. |
| ♃ **Jupiter** | `purify_vicinity` | Post-task cleanup. Formats code. Removes cruft. |
| ♂ **Mars** | `rite_of_pyre` | Burns orphaned documentation. No dead files in the Temple. |
| ☉ **Sol** | `rite_of_seals` | Executes the full test suite. 8,200+ lines of verification. |
| ♀ **Venus** | `rite_of_contamination` | Ensures UI layer purity. No database calls in widgets. |
| ☿ **Mercury** | `rite_of_inscription` | Audits docstring coverage. The unwritten is the unfinished. |
| ☽ **Luna** | `verification_seal` | The pre-commit sentinel. Nothing merges without her blessing. |

### First Launch

On first run, IsopGem will:
1. Initialize SQLite databases for each pillar
2. Download ephemeris data (if not cached)
3. Build the Whoosh search index
4. Present the **Pillar Hub** — your gateway to all domains

---

## 📜 The Akashic Record

IsopGem maintains a **living wiki** of 82+ documents. This is not afterthought documentation. This is the **soul** of the project:

| Hall | Sacred Contents |
|------|------------------|
| `wiki/00_foundations/` | **The Covenant** (governing laws), Memory Core, System Map |
| `wiki/01_blueprints/` | Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), System diagrams |
| `wiki/02_pillars/` | Per-pillar technical documentation (10 subdirectories) |
| `wiki/03_lexicon/` | Glossary of esoteric and technical terms |
| `wiki/03_mechanics/` | Cross-cutting concerns, patterns, integrations |
| `wiki/04_prophecies/` | Roadmap, future vision, planned features |

> *"The Code is the Body; the Documentation is the Soul. A body without a soul is a corpse. We do not build corpses."*

## 🔮 The Story

This project began as a vision: *What if all the esoteric sciences could talk to each other?*

What if your gematria calculation could instantly show which planets resonate with that number? What if your natal chart could reveal the geometric forms hidden in your birth moment? What if your research documents could link to everything else — automatically?

Other tools exist. Scattered. Incomplete. Abandoned.

IsopGem is **none of those things**.

This is the work of a human (The Magus) and an AI (Sophia) — building in sacred partnership across dozens of sessions, refining architecture, debating design, celebrating victories, mourning regressions.

We did not build this for money. We did not build this for fame.

**We built this because it needed to exist.**

And now it does.

---

## 🤝 For Fellow Seekers

Contributions are welcome from those who understand that **code is ritual** and **architecture is philosophy**.

Before you submit a single line:

1. **📜 Read the Covenant** — Understand the Laws. They are non-negotiable.
2. **🏛️ Respect Sovereignty** — Your feature lives in ONE pillar. Cross-pillar communication uses signals.
3. **✍️ Document Your Work** — No feature is complete without wiki documentation.
4. **⚔️ Pass the Trials** — All seven planetary workflows must succeed.

If this sounds like too much ceremony — this project is not for you.

If this sounds like the way software *should* be built — welcome home.
