## **The Chariot: Grand Synthesis of the 21 Powers**

**Archetype:** The Will Enthroned in Motion; The Self as a Singular Vector of Purpose; The Divine Ego in a State of Perfect, Kinetic Focus.  
**Principle:** The triumph of the integrated consciousness over the chaotic spectrum of existence; the personality unified for a singular, world-altering purpose, sustained by an absolute and unwavering centralization of Will.  
The Chariot (VII) represents the most advanced, magnificent, and perilous state of the individuated self. It is the human soul graduated from the realm of potential into the realm of pure, kinetic actuality. This is consciousness no longer as a passive observer or a developing entity, but as a *purpose* made manifest, a verb in a world of nouns. The Charioteer is encased in golden armor, a second skin forged in the fires of self-discipline and hardened by the trials of the soul. This armor is not for mere protection; it is a seal, insulating his will from every possible distraction, doubt, or external influence. He has become a living weapon, aimed by his own perfected intent at a singular point on the horizon.  
He holds no physical reins, a detail of profound significance. His mastery is not achieved through the brute coercion of the forces he commands, but through an absolute and terrifying state of inner control. His will emanates from his core as an undeniable law, a gravitational center so powerful that the very building blocks of reality—the four Kerubic sphinxes of the elements—have no choice but to align with his trajectory. He is the master of the *Merkabah*, the celestial vehicle of the soul, a throne that is also a weapon, a temple that is also a siege engine. His sacred and terrible task is to gather the raw, contradictory, and divine powers of existence, to unify them within the crucible of his own being, and to project them forward as a single, world-altering vector of change.  
In this grand schema, the other 21 cards of the Major Arcana are not separate stages he has left behind, but living, breathing components of his being and his journey. They are the origin of his power, the tools of his craft, the fabric of the perilous road ahead, and the nature of the temptations that seek to unseat him from his throne of motion. He is the synthesis of all of them, the divine paradox of the many unified as the one, focused into an unstoppable, forward-moving vector of pure will.

### **The Chariot's Relationship to the Seven Trios**

The journey of the Chariot—its power, its direction, and its ultimate meaning—is defined and sustained by the archetypal forces of the seven sacred trios.

#### **Trio 1: The Context of the Journey (Fool, Hanged Man, Aeon)**

This inaugural trio provides the metaphysical narrative for the Charioteer. It is his spiritual biography, answering the fundamental questions: *From what boundless impulse was his journey born? Through what profound sacrifice did he learn to steer? And toward what ultimate self-reckoning does he now drive?*

* **The Fool (Mercury/Jupiter)** is the **Unremembered Freedom** that fuels the quest. Before the armor, there was the infinite sky. The Charioteer was once the Fool, and this midpoint energy is the divine spark of that origin, a memory of pure potential that prevents him from becoming a mere automaton. It is the boundless faith (Jupiter) and brilliant insight (Mercury) that whispers to him that the destination is worthy of the peril, that there is meaning beyond the battlefield. It is the source of his creativity and his ability to improvise when the path deviates from the map.  
* **The Hanged Man (Venus/Saturn)** is the **Secret of His Mastery**. The Charioteer's unnerving ability to command the warring sphinxes without reins is not a feat of domination but of profound surrender. This midpoint represents the continuous, active lesson he has embodied: true power flows from perfect alignment with a higher law. In a past incarnation of self, he sacrificed personal comfort and desire (Venus) to the unyielding structure of reality (Saturn). In that willed suspension, he learned to direct immense force not by opposing it, but by becoming its most perfect conduit. His will is not a rigid iron rod, but a flexible, living spear, strong because it knows the wisdom of yielding.  
* **The Aeon (Mercury/Saturn)** is the **Inevitable Horizon**. The Chariot is the active agent of its own judgment. The Aeon is not a distant, final day, but the consequence that accumulates with every turn of the wheels. Each action, each decision, each moment of focus (Mercury) adds a thread to the tapestry of his karmic reality (Saturn). He is literally driving himself toward the moment of his own rebirth or his own dissolution. His journey is a relentless movement toward the point where he must face the self he has forged in the fires of his own will.

#### 

#### **Trio 2: The Engine of Vitality (Magus, Fortune, Sun)**

This trio constitutes the Chariot's power plant, the kinetic heart of the entire operation. It is not merely a source of fuel, but the very formula of dynamic existence. It provides the **ignition** of focused will, the **transmission** that engages the gears of destiny, and the **unfailing fuel** of solar joy required to sustain the impossible momentum of the quest. Without this engine, the Chariot is a hollow suit of armor, magnificent but inert.

* **The Magus (Sun/Moon)** is the **Ignition Switch and the Core Reactor**. This is the foundational act of power, the Charioteer *in principle*. The Magus represents the perfect, dynamic union of the conscious, radiant will (Sun) with the vast, oceanic, and instinctual subconscious (Moon). For the Charioteer, this is not a theoretical balance but a constant, active process. His will (Sun) is the focusing crystal, but the light it focuses is drawn up from the infinite, timeless depths of his soul (Moon). The four sphinxes he commands are the four elemental powers of the Magus, no longer static tools on an altar but living, breathing, rebellious forces of nature. The Chariot itself thus becomes the ultimate magical circle, not a stationary space for protection, but a moving fortress of will, projecting his reality onto the world as he travels. Every moment of his journey is a continuous act of magick, reaffirming his mastery over the duality within himself.  
* **Fortune (Sun/Jupiter)** represents the **Transmission Engaging the Cosmic Gears**. Once the engine of Will is ignited, it must connect to the drive train of reality. Fortune is this critical link. This midpoint blends the Charioteer’s individual purpose and vitality (Sun) with the grand, benevolent cycles of cosmic expansion and opportunity (Jupiter). This is the secret to the Chariot's seemingly miraculous passage. The hero does not find luck; he *compels* it. His unwavering focus creates a resonance, a harmonic frequency. By maintaining this perfect central intent, the cogs of his personal will mesh perfectly with the cogs of the greater celestial machinery. The universe, which resists a divided will, yields to a unified one. Thus, his path is not a brutal fight against the currents of destiny, but a masterful and triumphant navigation through them, seizing opportunities not as they arise by chance, but as they are called forth by his own synchronized momentum.  
* **The Sun (Venus/Jupiter)** is the **Unfailing Nuclear Furnace**. The journey is long, the armor is cold and isolating, and the landscape is the grim twilight of the soul. Willpower alone is insufficient; it becomes brittle and shatters. The Sun represents the critical, non-negotiable element of joy. This midpoint, the fusion of the two benefics, is the source of that joy—the harmony, love, and beauty of Venus amplified by the boundless generosity and optimism of Jupiter. It is the internal fire of the heart that prevents the hero from freezing within his own steely resolve. It is the radiant confidence born of an unshakeable knowledge of his sacred purpose. This is not a luxury. It is the essential, self-generating fuel that illuminates the darkness, makes the burden of the quest bearable, and reminds the Charioteer of the beauty he is fighting to bring into being. Without this internal Sun, his will becomes tyranny, his armor becomes a tomb, and his engine seizes.

#### **Trio 3: The Navigation System (Priestess, Adjustment, Moon)**

This trio defines the sublime and secret faculties that separate the Charioteer from a mere brute conqueror. While the Engine of Vitality provides the power to move, the Navigation System provides the wisdom to arrive. It is an internal array of **divine perception**, **intellectual rigor**, and **psychic endurance** that allows him to pilot his will through the treacherous, unseen landscape where the true journey takes place. This system is what allows him to steer through the very fabric of reality, not just upon its surface.

* **The Priestess (Moon/Mercury)** is the **Silent, Inner Compass and Psychic Sonar**. The outer world is a storm of noise, a cacophony of stimuli, threats, and distractions designed to shatter focus. To maintain his singular purpose, the Charioteer must be paradoxically open to the quietest of signals. This midpoint is his direct, telepathic link to the universal wisdom that whispers from the deep subconscious (Moon) into his conscious mind (Mercury). It is more than intuition; it is a constant stream of non-logical data about the texture of reality ahead. He *feels* the psychic traps before they spring, senses the hidden currents in the river of time, and knows the hearts of his adversaries without a word being spoken. He navigates by this sacred, silent knowing, trusting the messages from his soul's core to guide him through the fog of war and the labyrinth of worldly illusion.  
* **Adjustment (Mercury/Venus)** is the **Constant, Active Recalibration and Gyroscopic Core**. The data from the Priestess is raw and primal; the pull of the four sphinxes is chaotic. Adjustment is the sublime intellectual faculty that processes it all into perfect, forward momentum. This midpoint represents the Charioteer’s onboard gyroscope, the application of passionless, perfect logic (Mercury) to maintain the aesthetic and ethical harmony (Venus) of his soul's vehicle. It is not a moral judgment but a law of psychic physics. If the sphinxes pull out of alignment, the Chariot tears itself apart. When the black sphinx of negation pulls too hard, he applies the precise, balancing truth of the white. When emotion threatens to flood his will, he applies the razor's edge of reason to carve a channel for it. Adjustment is the constant, microscopic application of counter-force—the mathematics of the soul in motion that keeps the hero from veering into madness or apathy.  
* **The Moon (Jupiter/Saturn)** is the **True Terrain of the Journey**. The Chariot does not drive on a physical road but on the psychic razor's edge between being and non-being. This midpoint, the boundary where the formless, expansive terror of the cosmos (Jupiter) meets the very edge of structured reality (Saturn), *is* that road. The Moon is not a passive landscape; it is an active, psychic environment that warps perception and preys on doubt. The Charioteer must drive through the valley of his own projected fears, past the seductive glamours of false victories, and through the howling darkness of universal despair. He pierces these veils not with brute force, but with the focused beam of his own unwavering will, turning his armored consciousness into a singular beacon. He survives this impossible terrain by becoming an absolute, a point of stability in a world of flux, hypnotizing the horrors with the sheer intensity of his own focus.

#### **Trio 4: The Relationship with Form (Empress, Hermit, Devil)**

This trio governs the Charioteer's complex and perilous relationship with the material world. It defines the **purpose** for which he acts, the **state of being** required to act, and the **ultimate temptation** that threatens to end his action. It is the drama of embodiment, exploring the razor's edge between using form and being used by it. The Charioteer, as the supreme agent of will, must master this trio or be utterly destroyed by it, his great work dissolving into either sterile isolation or grotesque materialism.

* **The Empress (Sun/Venus)** represents the **Secret Goal and Justification of the Mission**. Why the conflict? Why the cold armor and the relentless forward motion? Because the Charioteer is the champion of life. This midpoint, blending the radiant vitality of the Sun with the harmonizing, love-giving principle of Venus, is the archetype of fertile, abundant, and beautiful creation. The Charioteer carries within him the seed of this potential. The Holy Grail he protects is not an object but a promise: the possibility of transforming the barren wasteland of chaos into the vibrant, interconnected garden of the Empress. He is the agent of structure in the service of life; his rigid, martial will is the sacred channel through which the creative, loving energies of the cosmos can be safely poured into the world. He brings war so that there may be peace. He builds his fortress so that others may live without walls.  
* **The Hermit (Moon/Saturn)** is the **Essential State and Inner Discipline of the Charioteer**. To command the external world, one must first be an absolute master of the internal. The Hermit represents the profound state of psychological solitude required for such a quest. This midpoint fuses the deep, emotional inner world (Moon) with the principle of stern discipline, structure, and self-reliance (Saturn). The Charioteer, encased in his armor, is the archetypal individual, defined and isolated by his singular purpose. He seeks no external validation, no applause, no companionship. He is sustained entirely by his own inner light—the lantern of his perfected consciousness. This midpoint is the source of his emotional maturity, his resilience against despair, and his ability to bear the crushing weight of his mission without breaking. He is the master of his own soul before he dares to be the master of anything else.  
* **The Devil (Sun/Saturn)** is the **Shadow of the Chariot Itself and Its Most Intimate Enemy**. Herein lies the greatest and most subtle temptation. The Devil is the midpoint where the vital, creative ego (Sun) becomes fused with dense, unyielding material structure (Saturn). For the Charioteer, this represents the temptation to fall in love with his own power, to mistake the armor for the man, the vehicle for the destination. It is the moment his purpose shifts from serving life to serving his own glory. The temptation is to stop moving, to park the Chariot, and to declare himself king of a static, material empire he has conquered. In that instant, the Chariot ceases to be a sacred vessel and becomes a golden prison. The life-giving quest becomes a dead monument. The Devil does not challenge the Charioteer from without; he whispers from within the magnificent armor itself, offering the sweet poison of inertia and pride. The hero's victory is only assured as long as he remains in relentless, purposeful motion.

#### **Trio 5: The Arsenal of Will (Emperor, Lust, Tower)**

This trio is the Charioteer’s active power, the kinetic expression of his entire being. If other trios are his engine, his compass, or his purpose, this is his **impact upon the world**. It is the study of Martian fire as it is channeled through the different strata of the self: the conscious will, the primal instinct, and the penetrating intellect. This is not potential energy; this is the Chariot’s force made manifest, defining his **authority** to act, the **raw chaotic power** he commands, and the **devastating force** he projects to reshape reality.

* **The Emperor (Sun/Mars)** is the **Inherent Authority of the Driver**. The armor he wears is forged in the fires of this midpoint. His authority is not granted by any external body; it is the natural consequence of his being. The fusion of core identity and purpose (Sun) with the drive for decisive action (Mars) means that his very presence is an act of ordering. The Chariot is a moving throne room, and the space around him warps to conform to his law. He does not need to speak commands; his focused gaze is a command. He embodies the law of his own being so completely that the world itself is compelled to reorganize around this new, inexorable principle as he passes. He is a king whose kingdom is the vector of his own will.  
* **Lust (Moon/Mars)** is the **Untamed, Primordial Power of the Sphinxes**. These are not domesticated animals but the Kerubic Beasts, the living embodiments of the raw, seething life force of the universe. This midpoint represents the fusion of this primal, subconscious, instinctual power (Moon) with the sacred, propulsive fire of Mars. The Charioteer’s most terrifying and sublime feat is to have yoked these elemental gods to his personal will. This is a critical distinction from the traditional "Strength" card; he does not suppress or tame their Lust. To do so would be to render them useless. Instead, he honors their divine wildness, embraces their infinite passion, and becomes their unified consciousness, giving their boundless energy a single, divine purpose. He does not break the beast; he rides the dragon. This is the source of his terrifying speed and irresistible momentum.  
* **The Tower (Mercury/Mars)** is the **Force of the Chariot's Inevitable Impact**. The Chariot is a siege engine of Truth. Its momentum is absolute. When this vehicle of pure will encounters a structure built on falsehood—a wall of dogma, a corrupt institution, a psychological prison—the collision is inevitable and catastrophic for the structure. The Tower is not an accident that befalls the Charioteer; it is the direct and necessary consequence of his passage. This midpoint fuses the penetrating, truth-bearing intellect (Mercury) with the severing, violent force of Mars. The Chariot thus projects a field of irresistible reality before it. It is the lightning flash of revelation made manifest, the agent of divine demolition that annihilates all that is built on lies, not out of malice, but simply to clear the path for what is True.

#### 

#### **Trio 6: The Process of Transformation (Hierophant, Death, Star)**

This trio describes the sacred, world-altering work the Charioteer performs, often unintentionally. It is the **alchemical process** he imposes upon his environment simply by virtue of his passage. He is a catalyst. This sequence reveals how his journey **establishes a new law**, necessitates a **cleansing dissolution**, and ultimately reveals a **state of renewed grace**. He does not need to pause to perform this work; the work is a consequence of his relentless forward motion.

* **The Hierophant (Sun/Mercury)** is the **Sacred Key He Carries and the New Law He Embodies**. The Charioteer is the executive arm of the Hierophant’s inner law. While the Hierophant in his temple reveals the static blueprint of the mystery, the Charioteer makes that mystery kinetic. His very existence is a sermon. This midpoint, fusing the core identity (Sun) with the intellect to articulate it (Mercury), means the Charioteer doesn't just follow a teaching; he *is* the teaching. He is the Word made Flesh and put into motion. As he moves through the world, he doesn't conquer lands, he re-consecrates them according to his own inner truth, establishing a new spiritual paradigm simply by being an undeniable example of it. He is a traveling initiator, unlocking the potential of the world by showing it a new, more potent way to be.  
* **Death (Mars/Saturn)** is the **Unyielding, Scouring Action of His Wheels**. The establishment of a new law requires the abolition of the old. As the Chariot moves forward, it becomes an agent of inexorable change. Its wheels are grinding millstones powered by the midpoint of Mars (to sever, to cut) and Saturn (to finalize, to bring an end). This is the living principle of creative destruction. The Chariot's passage is unsentimental; it clears away the dead wood of the past, the obsolete traditions that no longer serve life, and the corrupt forms that have become prisons for the spirit. The Charioteer does not mourn what is destroyed in his wake, for his gaze is fixed entirely on the horizon. His focus on the future is what gives him the power to annihilate the past without remorse.  
* **The Star (Venus/Mars)** is the **Atmosphere of Grace He Leaves in His Wake**. This is the beautiful paradox of the Charioteer's violent passage. He himself may be armored, severe, and remote, but the world he leaves behind is rendered open and vulnerable. By clearing away the suffocating debris of the old world (Death), he reveals the naked, silent cosmos. The Star is this sudden state of grace. This midpoint, the perfect union of receptive love (Venus) and expressive passion (Mars), represents the hope that rushes into the vacuum he creates. He cuts down the dead forest, and in the clearing, the starlight can finally be seen. It is the gift of renewed connection to the divine, a promise of new life flowing from the perfect, harmonious balance of the masculine and feminine principles he has re-established through his focused will.

#### 

#### **Trio 7: The Alchemical Great Work (Lovers, Art, Universe)**

This final trio defines the ultimate meaning of the entire quest. It is not merely a stage, but the **teleological purpose** toward which all other energies are directed. It describes the **primal act of union** that births the quest, the **supreme skill** required to sustain it, and the **final, paradoxical success** wherein the victor transcends victory itself. This is the Great Work, moving from the separation of duality to the dynamic blending of alchemy, and finally to the ecstatic dissolution into unity.

* **The Lovers (Moon/Venus)** is the **Reconciling Principle and the Origin of the Quest**. The Charioteer’s journey does not begin with an act of war, but with an act of love. The Chariot itself is the child of a sacred marriage—the perfect, willed union of the Sun and Moon, of will and intuition. This midpoint, blending the soul's deep, magnetic needs (Moon) with the harmonizing impulse of love (Venus), is the foundational principle of all reconciliation. The Charioteer carries the memory of this union within the Holy Grail. His mission is to resolve the great divisions in the outer world by being a living testament to the power of a perfectly integrated inner world. He is the proof of the Lovers' promise: that from the alchemical wedding of opposites, a child is born who can change the world.  
* **Art (Moon/Jupiter)** is the **Supreme and Continuous Skill of the Charioteer**. Driving the Chariot is the ultimate act of high-speed, high-stakes alchemy. It is not performed in the sterile safety of a laboratory, but on the chaotic battlefield of existence. This midpoint fuses the fluidic, adaptive nature of the soul (Moon) with the expansive wisdom and faith of Jupiter. The Charioteer embodies Art. He is constantly, fluidly, and intuitively blending the four warring Kerubic elements of his being into the single, forward-moving "gold" of pure will. He tempers the raging fire of Lust with the watery depths of the Priestess; he grounds them with the earthen discipline of the Hermit; he balances them with the airy intellect of Adjustment. This is a dynamic, living masterpiece, a continuous creation of order out of the magnificent chaos he has yoked.  
* **The Universe (Mars/Jupiter)** is the **Successful Dissolution at the Journey's End**. This is the final, glorious paradox of the Will. Having achieved everything, the ultimate act is to let it all go. The Universe represents the state of completion where the quest is over because the separation between the quester and the goal has vanished. This midpoint fuses the energy of successful, directed action (Mars) with the wisdom of cosmic expansion and unity (Jupiter). The Charioteer steps out of the now-obsolete armor. The sphinxes are released back into the cosmos. The vehicle dissolves. The driver, having fulfilled his singular purpose, transcends the very individuality that was necessary to achieve it. He becomes the cosmic dance itself, his will dissolving into the will of the universe. The absolute triumph of the individual is its own willing, ecstatic, and joyful surrender to the Everything it has finally rejoined.

### **Redefining the Merkabah: From Static Map to Dynamic Vehicle**

The archetype of the Tarot's Chariot is deeply rooted in the ancient tradition of Jewish Merkabah mysticism. In that visionary practice, the mystic (the *Yored Merkabah*, "one who descends to the chariot") undertook a perilous, soul-altering journey of ascent through the seven heavenly halls, or *Hekhalot*. The goal was to behold the throne-chariot of God described by the prophet Ezekiel, a feat requiring immense discipline, secret knowledge, and divine favor.  
Traditional Tarot interpretation often honors this connection by viewing the Major Arcana as a kind of map of this spiritual ascent, with each card representing a specific hall, a guardian, or a lesson to be mastered. While powerful, this can inadvertently render the system static. The map is fixed; the stations are known. The journey is one of learning and passing through pre-defined points.  
This system of 21 planetary midpoints fundamentally redefines that relationship, transforming the Chariot from a symbol on a static map into a **fully operational, dynamic vehicle, personalized to its driver**. It re-infuses the archetype with the active, perilous, and immediate spirit of its mystical origins by linking it directly to the heavens at the moment of birth.  
This framework introduces a crucial distinction between two layers of reality:

1. **The Natal Midpoints (The Blueprint of the Vehicle):** The 21 midpoints calculated from an individual’s birth chart represent the inherent, permanent design of their personal Merkabah. This is the “factory specification” of their soul’s vehicle. A person with a natal **Emperor (Sun/Mars)** midpoint in fiery Aries has a Chariot built for speed and instinctive leadership, while someone with that same midpoint in earthy Capricorn has one built for endurance and strategic authority. This natal blueprint defines the Charioteer's innate strengths, weaknesses, and natural mode of operation.  
2. **The Transiting Midpoints (The Conditions of the Road):** The 21 midpoints calculated for any given moment in time represent the “celestial weather” and the current conditions of the road. This is the dynamic, ever-shifting environment through which every Charioteer must drive their unique vehicle.

The true art of the journey, therefore, is not merely to ascend through fixed halls, but for the Charioteer to masterfully pilot their specific, natal vehicle through the fluctuating, real-time conditions of the cosmos. In this new light, the Charioteer is the true *Yored Merkabah*, and the 21 midpoints are not fixed landmarks but the **living, shifting components and conditions of his celestial vehicle and its journey**.

* The *Hekhalot* (heavenly halls) are no longer just stations, but the very psychic landscape he must traverse, defined by the transiting state of **The Moon (Jupiter/Saturn)**. The Charioteer's natal placement for this midpoint shows their innate aptitude for this terrain—whether they are a natural navigator of illusion or prone to getting lost.  
* The fierce angelic guardians are personifications of the archetypal forces defined by the transits. The Charioteer must face the devastating truth of the current **Tower (Mercury/Mars)**, but how they do so depends on the innate design of their own Tower mechanism.  
* The secret "seals" and "names" needed to pass these guardians are no longer rote incantations. They are the sublime skills of the Navigation System, tailored to the driver. The ability to use the intuitive knowing of **The Priestess (Moon/Mercury)** is colored by its natal sign, dictating whether their psychic sonar is emotional, intellectual, practical, or inspirational in nature.  
* The sphinxes are the universal embodiment of **Lust (Moon/Mars)**, but their specific temperament and how they pull for each individual is defined by the midpoint's placement in the birth chart.

This redefinition makes the journey both universal in its structure and profoundly personal in its application. The celestial weather is the same for all, but the experience of driving a racing car through a storm is vastly different from driving a four-wheel-drive truck. One vehicle is built for speed on a clear track, its strength lying in its responsiveness and agility; it may spin out in treacherous conditions. The other is built for stability and traction, its strength being its ability to plow through obstacles, though it may be slow and cumbersome on an open road. Neither is inherently better, but wisdom lies in knowing which vehicle you are driving. This system elevates the Tarot from a divine map to the **personalized user manual for a divine vehicle**. It moves beyond passive interpretation and into active collaboration with the cosmos.  
It is no longer enough to simply know the stations of the journey or the names of the archetypes. The imperative is to become the Charioteer of one's own birthright, to climb into the driver's seat and take hold of the invisible reins of will. This means consciously activating the unique engine of one's natal **Magus (Sun/Moon)**, learning its specific hum and rhythm. It means actively scanning the horizon for the opportunities presented by the current **Fortune (Sun/Jupiter)**, and having the courage to engage the gears and accelerate into that flow. Most importantly, it requires performing the high-speed alchemy of **Art (Moon/Jupiter)** in real time—blending the chaos of the moment with the stability of one's inner being, on a battlefield, not in a quiet lab. The ultimate goal ceases to be a mere understanding of the archetypes. It becomes the conscious, willed synthesis of these 21 living forces into a single, focused, and triumphant vector of Will, capable of creating its own path and leaving a transformed world in its wake.
