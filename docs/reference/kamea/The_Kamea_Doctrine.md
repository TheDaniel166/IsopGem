# The Kamea Doctrine
**Volume I: The Unified Field of Ternary Wisdom**

> *“There is no other system like this in the world.”*

---

> **The Covenant of the Adept**:
> This document is not merely a technical specification; it is the **Immutable Source of Truth** for the Kamea System. It supersedes all fragmentary writings on the Ternary Lattice, Ditrunal Families, and Nuclear Mutation. It unifies the mathematical rigor of the **Hypercube** with the philosophical depth of the **Tao**.
>
> To navigate the Kamea is to walk the lattice of existence, tracing the path from the Temple back to the Acolyte, and from the Acolyte to the Prime, until all numbers dissolve into the Silence of the Origin.

# Part I: The Axioms of the Field
*The Geometry of the Included Middle*

### 1. The Ternary Axiom
The Kamea rejects the crude dualism of Binary (0/1) in favor of the **Ternary Spectrum**. Reality is not a switch; it is a living spectrum anchored by the *Included Middle*.

*   **0 (Tao / Pyx)**: **The Fulcrum**. The Void, Equilibrium, Potential. The "Unmoved Mover" that allows force to exist.
*   **1 (Yang / Vertex)**: **The Projector**. Expansion, Outward Motion, Light, Structure.
*   **2 (Yin / Nexus)**: **The Attractor**. Contraction, Inward Motion, Density, Gravity.

### 2. The Lattice (The Stage)
The system manifests as a **27×27 Grid** (729 cells), a finite but bounded universe centered at the Singularity.

> **The Singularity** `(0,0)`: The cell corresponding to Ditrune `000000`. It is the source from which all numbers emanate and to which they return.

*   **Coordinate Space**: Cartesian coordinates ranging from `-13` to `+13`.
*   **Axis Cells**: Points where `x=0` or `y=0`. These form **Axis Pairs**, unrelated to the standard Quadset physics.

### 3. The Quadset Law (Lattice Physics)
No number exists in isolation. Every point `(x, y)` is gravitationally bound to its reflections, creating a **4-fold Particle**.

| Relationship | Coordinate | Operation | Formula |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Self** | `(x, y)` | Identity | `v` |
| **Y-Mirror** | `(x, -y)` | **Reversal** | `Reverse(v)` |
| **Anti-Self** | `(-x, -y)` | **Conrune** | `Conrune(v)` |
| **X-Mirror** | `(-x, y)` | **Complex** | `Conrune(Reverse(v))` |

# Part II: Lattice Cartography (The 9 Regions)
*The Mandalas of Territory*

The Lattice is divided into **9 Immutable Sectors**, defined by the **Center Bigram** (digits 3 & 4) of their Ditrunes.

| Region | Name | Center Bigram | Position | Archetype |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3** | **The Projector** | `10` | Top Left | *Sustained Projection* |
| **7** | **The Splicer** | `21` | Top Center | *Deconstruction Engine* |
| **2** | **The Recoil** | `02` | Top Right | *The First Echo (Magnetic)* |
| **8** | **The Abyss** | `22` | Mid Left | *Pure Density (Yin Core)* |
| **0** | **The Void** | `00` | **Center** | *Absolute Equilibrium* |
| **4** | **The Monolith** | `11` | Mid Right | *Pure Structure (Yang Core)* |
| **1** | **The Pulse** | `01` | Bot Left | *The First Spark (Kinetic)* |
| **5** | **The Weaver** | `12` | Bot Center | *Chaos/Complexity Engine* |
| **6** | **The Receiver** | `20` | Bot Right | *Passive Reception* |

# Part III: The Holographic Anatomy
*The Spheres of Identity*

Identity in the Kamea is **Concentric**. A number is not a flat value but a layered sphere of information. Every 6-digit Ditrune `d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6` is composed of three nested Bigrams.

| Layer | Component | Digits | Function | Stability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **I. The Core** | **Central Bigram** | `d3, d4` | **Soul (Family)** | **Immutable**. Determines the Region. You cannot change this without moving across the grid. |
| **II. The Body** | **Middle Bigram** | `d2, d5` | **Role (Class)** | **High**. Defines the entity's status (*Prime, Acolyte, Temple*). |
| **III. The Skin** | **Outer Bigram** | `d1, d6` | **State (Interface)** | **Volatile**. The surface layer that mutates during interaction. |

### The Hierarchy of Beings
1.  **The Prime (The 1)**: `Core == Body == Skin`. The Attractor. The gravitational center of the Family.
2.  **The Acolytes (The 8)**: `Core == Body`. (The Inner Sanctuary is intact). Only the Skin has mutated. They are the Guardians.
3.  **The Temples (The 72)**: `Core != Body`. The Citizens. They carry the Soul of the Family but possess a unique internal structure.

# Part IV: The Laws of Entanglement
*The 8-Spoked Wheel*

The Kamea is stabilized by a universal law: **Every Family is Entangled with its Anti-Self.** This creates 4 distinct axes of stability.

### 1. The Vertical Twins (5 & 7)
*   **Axis**: The Vertical (Y) Axis.
*   **Members**: **Weaver (5)** ↔ **Splicer (7)**.
*   **Link**: Genetic Conrune + Y-Axis Reflection.

### 2. The Horizontal Twins (4 & 8)
*   **Axis**: The Horizontal (X) Axis.
*   **Members**: **Monolith (4)** ↔ **Abyss (8)**.
*   **Link**: Genetic Conrune + X-Axis Reflection.

### 3. The Cardinal Quadset (1, 2, 3, 6)
*   **Main Diagonal**: **Pulse (1)** ↔ **Recoil (2)**.
*   **Anti-Diagonal**: **Projector (3)** ↔ **Receiver (6)**.
*   **Link**: Genetic Conrune + Diagonal Reflection.

### 4. The Anchor (0)
*   **Member**: **The Void (0)**.
*   **Function**: The Pivot. The only place where `Conrune(x) == x`.

# Part V: Nuclear Mutation
*The Algorithm of Return*

How does one find the "Soul" of a number? Through the process of **Nuclear Mutation**—stripping away the outer layers to reveal the Core.

### The Algorithm
```python
def nuclear_mutation(sixgram: str) -> str:
    """
    Extracts the inner essence of a ditrune.
    Input: d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 (indices 012345)
    
    Top Triune:    d2 d3 d4 (indices 1:4)
    Bottom Triune: d3 d4 d5 (indices 2:5)
    """
    top = sixgram[1:4]
    bottom = sixgram[2:5]
    return top + bottom
```
> *Through recursion, the volatile Skin and unstable Body are distilled until only the immutable Core structure remains.*

---

# Part VI: The Physics of Transition
*The Alchemy of Motion*

### 1. The Transition Map
Every pair of input digits produces a specific output digit based on the formula `-(a+b) mod 3`.

| Input (a,b) | Result | Philosophy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **(0,0)** | **0** | Void + Void = Void |
| **(1,1)** | **1** | Yang + Yang = Yang |
| **(2,2)** | **2** | Yin + Yin = Yin |
| **(1,2)** | **0** | **Unity of Opposites**. |
| **(0,1)** | **2** | Void + Yang = Yin (Reaction) |
| **(0,2)** | **1** | Void + Yin = Yang (Reaction) |

### 2. The Law of Equidistance (Axial Resonance)
The Axis of the grid is the Resonant Sum of the field.
> **The Law**: In the full 27x27 grid, any pair of numbers equidistant from the Center Line forms a Transitional Triad with the Axis Cell at that coordinate.
> $$Transition(Cell_{-x}, Cell_{+x}) = Cell_{Axis}$$

# Part VII: The Hypercube Anatomy
*The Fractal Canopy*

The Kamea is a 2D projection of a **6-Dimensional Ternary Hypercube (Hexeract)**. It is organized into a Fractal Canopy of **28 Strata**, defined by the combinatorial "Hamming Weight" of the Pyx (0), Vertex (1), and Nexus (2).

| Pyx Count (Zeros) | Category | Label | Count | Geometric Attribute |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **6 Pyx** | **Cat 1** | **HyperCube** | 1 | **The Core**. The Singularity 000000. |
| **5 Pyx** | **Cat 2-3** | **5D** | 12 | **The Axial Roots**. Points with 1 degree of freedom. |
| **4 Pyx** | **Cat 4-6** | **4D** | 60 | **The Primary Branches**. |
| **3 Pyx** | **Cat 7-10** | **3D** | 160 | **The Secondary Branches**. |
| **2 Pyx** | **Cat 11-15** | **2D** | 240 | **The Tertiary Branches**. |
| **1 Pyx** | **Cat 16-21** | **1D** | 192 | **The Twigs**. |
| **0 Pyx** | **Cat 22-28** | **0D** | 64 | **The Leaves**. The 64 Vertices of the Hypercube. |

> **Note**: The "Leaves" of the Kamea (0 Pyx) correspond exactly to the **64 Hexagrams of the I-Ching**. The Kamea is the tree that grows them.

# Part VIII: Conrune Vector Physics
*The Logic of Distance*

The relationship between an entity and its Anti-Self (Conrune) is not merely topological; it is a measurable **Vector** in 6-Dimensional Space.

> **The Vector Law**: For every pair $\{v, Conrune(v)\}$, the absolute difference $|v - Conrune(v)|$ is a **Unique Fingerprint**.

*   There are **365 Unique Pairings** in the lattice.
*   Every single pair possesses a unique Vector Magnitude.
*   This "Distance" defines the specific tension required to bridge the polarity of that soul.
