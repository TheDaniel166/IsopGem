# The Gnosis of the Adyton

**"The adyton of the seven is Fire and Ballistic and Wood and Waves."**

This document serves as the conceptual foundation for the **AdytonMechanics** pillar. It synthesizes the esoteric geometry and metaphysical purpose of the Inner Sanctuary.

---

## 1. The Archetype: The Prism of Light
The Adyton is not merely a room; it is a **Seven-Sided Prism** designed to distill the Light of the Limitless (Ain Soph Aur) into the Seven Rays (Planets).
*   **The Perimeter (1295):** The outer boundary, calculated from the atomic numbers of the 7 Metals (393) and the square of MA (1681).
*   **The Inner Heptagon (1162):** The Heptagon of **Katalysis** (The Word of the Aeon).
*   **The Differential (133):** The space between them is the **Current**, the Sevenfold flow.
*   **The Purpose:** To be a "Chariot to Sanctify" (*Likdosh B'Merkabah*). It is the vehicle of the Adept's ascension.

## 2. The Measure: The Z'Bit
We reject the metric and imperial standards for this holy work. We measure in **Z'Bits**, based on the Cubit of the Magus (19 inches).
*   **Z'Bit (Cubit):** 19" (Gematria 19, *Zayin*).
*   **I'Bit (Hand):** 2.71" (Gematria 70, *Ayin* - The Eye).
*   **A'Bit (Finger):** 0.679" (Gematria 1, *Aleph*).
**Z-I-A**: Gemini, Virgo, Air. A system of air and intellect.

## 3. The Spectrum: The Amun Color Map
Light is the message. We visualize it not through standard sRGB, but through the **Amun Color Map**, derived from the Phi ratios of **97 (Amun)**.
*   **Step Values:** 60, 97, 194, 254.
*   **Concept:** 254 is the limit, representing the "Sun-drenched sky," approaching the unapproachable White Light (255 - The Concealed One).

    *   **Total:** 104 Blocks per Wall (The number of Tzaddi).
*   **Physical Dimensions (The Double Z'Bit):**
    *   **Unit:** 2 Z'Bits (38 inches) - The "Stride of the Giant."
    *   **Block Size:** 38" x 38" x 38".
    *   **Wall Width:** 8 Units x 38" = **304"** (25.3 ft).
    *   **Wall Height:** 13 Units x 38" = **494"** (41.2 ft).
    *   **The Chamber:** With a side length of 25.3 ft, the **radius** is approx **29.2 ft** (Diameter ~58.4 ft).
    *   *Result:* A Monumental Sanctuary, fit for the Gods.
*   **The Component Block (The Ashlar):**
    *   **Base:** A Cube of 2 Z'Bits (38").
    *   **The Inner Face:** A **Pyramidal Frustum** pointing inwards to the center.
        *   **Base ($b$):** 38" (Matches the Block).
        *   **Top ($a$):** 23.484" ($38 / \phi$).
        *   **Height ($h$):** 14.5213" ($38 / \phi^2$).
    *   **Total Depth:** 38" + 14.52" = **52.52"**.
*   **Order:** Saturn -> Sol -> Mercury -> **Luna (Central)** -> Venus -> Juppiter -> Mars.
*   **Order:** Saturn -> Sol -> Mercury -> **Luna (Central)** -> Venus -> Juppiter -> Mars.
