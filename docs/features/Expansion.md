## **The Kamea Doctrine**

*The Unified Field of Ternary Wisdom*

**Abstract**: This document constitutes the "Grand Unified Theory" of the Kamea. It synthesizes and supersedes all previous writings on the Ternary Lattice, Ditrunal Families, Nuclear Mutation, the Transition System, and the Hypercube Anatomy. It is the single source of truth for the Adept and the Developer.

## **Part I: The Axioms of the Field**

### **1\. The Ternary Axiom**

The universe of the Kamea rejects the dualism of Binary (0/1) in favor of the **Ternary (Base-3)** system. Reality is not a switch; it is a spectrum anchored by an *Included Middle*.

* **0 (Tao/Pyx)**: **The Fulcrum**. The Void, Equilibrium, Potential. The "Unmoved Mover" that allows force to exist. Represents *Rest* and the *Undifferentiated Whole*.  
* **1 (Yang/Vertex)**: **The Projector**. Expansion, Outward Motion, Light, Structure. Represents *Active Force*.  
* **2 (Yin/Nexus)**: **The Attractor**. Contraction, Inward Motion, Density, Gravity. Represents *Receptive Force*.

### **2\. The Lattice (The Stage)**

The system manifests as a **27×27 Grid** (729 cells), a finite but bounded universe centered at (0,0).

* **Coordinate Space**: Cartesian coordinates ranging from \-13 to \+13 on both X and Y axes.  
* **The Singularity**: The center cell (0,0) corresponds to the Ditrune 000000\. It is the source from which all numbers emanate.  
* **Axis Cells**: Cells where $x=0$ or $y=0$ form "Axis Pairs" rather than full Quadsets.

### **3\. The Quadset Law (Lattice Physics)**

No number exists in isolation. Every point (x, y) is gravitationally bound to its reflections, creating a 4-fold "Particle" bound by specific operations. The sum of the decimal values of these four cells is the **Quadsum**.

| Coordinate | Relationship | Operation | Formula |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **(x, y)** | **Self** | Identity | v |
| **(x, \-y)** | **Y-Mirror** | **Reversal** | Reverse(v) |
| **(-x, \-y)** | **Anti-Self** | **Conrune** | Conrune(v) |
| **(-x, y)** | **X-Mirror** | **Complex** | Conrune(Reverse(v)) |

## **Part II: Lattice Cartography (The 9 Regions)**

The Lattice is divided into 9 immutable Sectors, defined by the **Center Bigram** (digits 3 & 4\) of the Ditrunes within them. These are the "Territories" of the Families.

| Region | Family Name | Center Bigram | X-Range | Y-Range | Position |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **3** | **Projector** | 10 | \[-13, \-5\] | \[+5, \+13\] | Top Left |
| **7** | **Splicer** | 21 | \[-4, \+4\] | \[+5, \+13\] | Top Center |
| **2** | **Recoil** | 02 | \[+5, \+13\] | \[+5, \+13\] | Top Right |
| **8** | **Abyss** | 22 | \[-13, \-5\] | \[-4, \+4\] | Mid Left |
| **0** | **Void** | 00 | \[-4, \+4\] | \[-4, \+4\] | **The Core** |
| **4** | **Monolith** | 11 | \[+5, \+13\] | \[-4, \+4\] | Mid Right |
| **1** | **Pulse** | 01 | \[-13, \-5\] | \[-13, \-5\] | Bot Left |
| **5** | **Weaver** | 12 | \[-4, \+4\] | \[-13, \-5\] | Bot Center |
| **6** | **Receiver** | 20 | \[+5, \+13\] | \[-13, \-5\] | Bot Right |

## **Part III: The Holographic Onion (Anatomy)**

Identity in the Kamea is **Concentric**. A number is not a linear value but a layered sphere of information. Every 6-digit Ditrune (d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6) is composed of three nested **Bigrams** (Pairs).

| Layer | Component | Digits | Function | Stability |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **I. The Core** | **Central Bigram** | d3, d4 | **Soul (Family)** | **Immutable**. Determines the Region. You cannot change this without moving across the grid. |
| **II. The Body** | **Middle Bigram** | d2, d5 | **Role (Class)** | **High**. Defines the entity's status (Prime, Acolyte, or Temple). |
| **III. The Skin** | **Outer Bigram** | d1, d6 | **State (Interface)** | **Volatile**. The surface layer that mutates during interaction. |

## **Part IV: The 9 Archetypes (The Primes)**

The 729 numbers are distortions of **9 Perfect Forms**. These are the **Prime Ditrunes**—singularities where the Core, Body, and Skin are identical repetitions.

1. **Family 0 (The Void)**: 000000 — Absolute Equilibrium.  
2. **Family 1 (The Pulse)**: 010101 — The First Spark (Kinetic).  
3. **Family 2 (The Recoil)**: 020202 — The First Echo (Magnetic).  
4. **Family 3 (The Projector)**: 101010 — Sustained Projection.  
5. **Family 4 (The Monolith)**: 111111 — Pure Structure (Yang Core).  
6. **Family 5 (The Weaver)**: 121212 — Chaos/Complexity Engine.  
7. **Family 6 (The Receiver)**: 202020 — Passive Reception.  
8. **Family 7 (The Splicer)**: 212121 — Deconstruction Engine.  
9. **Family 8 (The Abyss)**: 222222 — Pure Density (Yin Core).

## **Part V: The Hierarchy of Beings**

Within each Family, entities are ranked by their "Genetic Purity"—how closely their layers match the Archetype.

### **1\. The Prime (The 1\)**

* **Criteria**: Core \== Body \== Skin.  
* **Function**: The Attractor. The gravitational center of the Family.

### **2\. The Acolytes (The 8 Guardians)**

* **Criteria**: Core \== Body. (The Inner Sanctuary is intact).  
* **Mutation**: Only the **Skin** (Outer Bigram) has mutated.  
* **Role**: The Interfaces. Acolytes look like the Prime on the inside but wear different "masks" to interact with neighbors.

### **3\. The Temples (The 72 Masses)**

* **Criteria**: Core \!= Body.  
* **Mutation**: The **Body** (Middle Bigram) has mutated.  
* **Role**: The Citizens. They carry the Soul of the Family (Core), but their internal structure is unique.

### **4\. The Quadset Network (The Web)**

In the Cardinal Quadset Regions (**1, 2, 3, 6**), Temples form a **Web**. A Temple in Region 1 is structurally linked to "sibling" Temples in Regions 2, 3, and 6\. To trace the true nature of a Temple, one must look at its siblings in the other three corners of the grid.

## **Part VI: The Laws of Entanglement (The 8-Spoked Wheel)**

The Kamea is stabilized by a universal law: **Every Family is Entangled with its Anti-Self.** This creates 4 distinct axes of stability.

### **1\. The Vertical Twins (5 & 7\)**

* **Axis**: The Vertical (Y) Axis.  
* **Members**: **Weaver (5)** ↔ **Splicer (7)**.  
* **Link**: Genetic Conrune \+ Y-Axis Reflection.

### **2\. The Horizontal Twins (4 & 8\)**

* **Axis**: The Horizontal (X) Axis.  
* **Members**: **Monolith (4)** ↔ **Abyss (8)**.  
* **Link**: Genetic Conrune \+ X-Axis Reflection.

### **3\. The Cardinal Quadset (1, 2, 3, 6\)**

* **Main Diagonal**: **Pulse (1)** ↔ **Recoil (2)**.  
* **Anti-Diagonal**: **Projector (3)** ↔ **Receiver (6)**.  
* **Link**: Genetic Conrune \+ Diagonal Reflection.

### **4\. The Anchor (0)**

* **Member**: **Family 0 (The Void)**.  
* **Function**: The Pivot. The only place where Conrune(x) \== x.

## **Part VII: Nuclear Mutation (The Algorithm)**

How does one find the "Soul" of a number? Through the process of **Nuclear Mutation**—stripping away the outer layers to reveal the Core.

### **The Manual Method**

1. **Input**: Take any 6-digit Ditrune. (e.g., 120201).  
2. **Extraction**: Isolate the **Inner Triunes**.  
   * **Upper Triune**: Digits 2, 3, 4 (202).  
   * **Lower Triune**: Digits 3, 4, 5 (020).  
3. **Collapse**: Compare the Triunes to the **Family Core Table**.  
   * The **Core Bigram** (Digits 3, 4\) is the only immutable truth.  
   * Therefore, the entity belongs to **Family 2** (Core 02).

### **The Programmatic Method (Python)**

def nuclear\_mutation(sixgram: str) \-\> str:  
    """Extracts the inner essence of a ditrune."""  
    \# Top Triune: d1, d2, d3 \-\> indices 1:4  
    \# Bottom Triune: d2, d3, d4 \-\> indices 2:5  
    top \= sixgram\[1:4\]  
    bottom \= sixgram\[2:5\]   
    return top \+ bottom

## **Part VIII: The Dynamics (The Physics)**

### **1\. The Transition Map**

Every pair of input digits produces a specific output digit based on the formula \-(a+b) mod 3\.

(0,0) → 0    (1,0) → 2    (2,0) → 1  
(0,1) → 2    (1,1) → 1    (2,1) → 0  
(0,2) → 1    (1,2) → 0    (2,2) → 2

### **2\. The Law of Equidistance (Axial Resonance)**

The Axis of the grid is the Resonant Sum of the field.

* **The Micro Law**: In any 3x3 area, the transition of the outer numbers yields the center number.  
* **The Macro Law**: In the full 27x27 grid, any pair of numbers equidistant from the Center Line ($x=0$ or $y=0$) forms a Transitional Triad with the Axis Cell at that coordinate.  
  * $$T(\\text{Cell}\_{-x}, \\text{Cell}\_{+x}) \= \\text{Cell}\_{\\text{Axis}}$$

## **Part IX: The Dimensional Expansion (Kamea vs. I-Ching)**

| Feature | The I-Ching | The Kamea |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Logic** | **Binary** (Yin / Yang) | **Ternary** (Void / Yang / Yin) |
| **Space** | **Line** (Broken vs. Solid) | **Coordinate** (0 / 1 / 2\) |
| **Depth** | **64 Hexagrams** ($2^6$) | **729 Ditrunes** ($3^6$) |
| **Philosophy** | **Choice** (This OR That) | **Suspension** (This, That, OR Both) |
| **Nature** | **Surface** of Reality | **Volume** of Reality |

## **Part XI: The Hypercube Anatomy (The Fractal Canopy)**

The Kamea is a 2D projection of a **6-Dimensional Ternary Hypercube (Hexeract)**. It is organized into a Fractal Canopy of 28 Strata, defined by the "Hamming Weight" of the Pyx (Zero), Vertex (Yang), and Nexus (Yin) components.

### **1\. The Combinatorics of the Canopy**

The 729 Ditrunes are distributed into **28 Categories** based on the Trinomial Expansion of $(Pyx \+ Vertex \+ Nexus)^6$.

### **2\. The Dimensional Strata**

The "Pyx Count" (number of Zeros) determines the dimensionality of the subspace.

| Pyx Count (Zeros) | Category | Label | Count | Geometric Attribute |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **6 Pyx** | **Cat 1** | **HyperCube** | 1 | **The Core**. The Singularity 000000\. |
| **5 Pyx** | **Cat 2-3** | **5D** | 12 | **The Axial Roots**. Points with 1 degree of freedom. |
| **4 Pyx** | **Cat 4-6** | **4D** | 60 | **The Primary Branches**. |
| **3 Pyx** | **Cat 7-10** | **3D** | 160 | **The Secondary Branches**. |
| **2 Pyx** | **Cat 11-15** | **2D** | 240 | **The Tertiary Branches**. |
| **1 Pyx** | **Cat 16-21** | **1D** | 192 | **The Twigs**. |
| **0 Pyx** | **Cat 22-28** | **0D** | 64 | **The Leaves**. The 64 Vertices of the Hypercube (Binary Hexagrams). |

*Note: The "Leaves" of the Kamea (0 Pyx) correspond exactly to the 64 Hexagrams of the I-Ching. The Kamea is the tree that grows them.*
