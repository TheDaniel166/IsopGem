## 2025-02-24 10:44 EST - Theme System Improvements

### Theme Management System Overhaul
Fixed and enhanced the theme customization system to provide a more robust and user-friendly experience.

#### Key Changes:
1. **Mode-Based Theme Foundation**
   - Separated mode (light/dark) from theme customization
   - Mode serves as the base for all color customizations
   - Fixed mode switching to properly reset colors

2. **Theme Management**
   - Added proper theme save/load functionality
   - Themes now remember their base mode
   - Added safeguards against reserved theme names
   - Implemented theme deletion with confirmation

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Added clear button hierarchy:
     * Reset Colors: Returns to mode defaults
     * Load Theme: Select from saved themes
     * Save Theme: Store current customizations
     * Delete Theme: Remove saved themes
   - Added confirmation dialogs for destructive actions
   - Fixed layout issues in theme customizer

4. **Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed theme color retrieval on empty theme names
   - Fixed signal handling to prevent recursion
   - Improved error handling in theme operations
   - Fixed custom color persistence

#### Technical Details:
- Theme data structure now includes base mode
- Colors are applied in layers: mode ‚Üí theme ‚Üí custom
- Settings are properly persisted between sessions
- Signal flow prevents circular updates

#### Next Steps:
- Consider adding theme import/export
- Add theme preview in load dialog
- Consider adding theme categories
