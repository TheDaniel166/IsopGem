Adepts and the Adyton                             The          C         hamber of the Adepts       
   is a          long-standing                   icon          within the Western Mystery 
tradition.          Its origins are found within the          Golden Dawn through the Rosicrucians. 
There is an abundance of information to be found on          it         , and I will leave this up 
to the individual Adept to discover. One of the clearest instructions within the Holy Books of MA 
concerns this chamber, and its uses.          Whether                   one          call         s 
         it the Chamber of the Adepts, the Adyton of the Seven,          or          the          
Sevenfold Cloister, it all means the same         .                     It is a place of meditation 
and ritual whose design          relates to          the deeper mysteries o         f Ma through 
its sacred geometry and mathematical synchronicity.          Thus,          the Chamber of the 
Adepts now is          retitled          and rei         nterpreted as the Adyton of the Seven      
   , which will serve as the Sevenfold Cloister of the Order of the Argentum Aurora.                
       The Adyton of the Seven is a reinterpretation of the Adept Chamber in terms of the Aeon of 
MA. There is much within our writings concerning this most celebrated idea. The use of the word 
Adyton itself is curious, as it means the innermost sanctuary of the temple, a place that only the 
priest could enter, and from which their oracles were received. This word is synonymous with “the 
Holy of Holies” or “the Inner Sanctum”. Within the structure of the Greek temples, the Adyton 
was a room within the Temple proper (           ναός), whose access was restricted. This holds 
an interesting history, for in the Ptolemaic period of Egypt, the Adyton referred to that which was 
hidden inside the Inner Sanctum of the Temples, existing in a darkness meant to represent the 
primordial darkness before creation.           Archaeologists            extended it           to   
         refer to the central room of pyramids. Around this room was often a Labyrinth of tunnels 
and paths meant to detour those who would rob and desecrate the tombs of those buried within.       
                  In Greek, the word Adyton is ΑΔΥΤΟΝ, equaling 825. The idea that the Adyton 
is concealed within the Temple is shown by the reversal of 825 which is 577, meaning, in Hebrew, 
“the Concealed of the Concealed”.  577 is also the sum of the first 3 words of the MAAT 
notariqon, meaning “Sanctuary of the Hidden Goddess”.                     תעלומה

              And herein           lies            another mystery, for 577 is the 106            
th            Prime, and this is the differential of 14° Cancer, the location of Sothis, which 
many consider to be the Silver Star, and represents this Hidden Goddess. In the Old Aeon lodge 
paradigm, the Order of the Silver Star was the Concealed of the Concealed orders and attributed to 
the Supernal Triad. These 3 Orders consist of 10 Grades. Yet in our Mysteries, these 3 Orders 
become symboli          c of the 3           St          a          t          es, and a           
re not in any sense hierarchical, but coexist within each other, and represent an initiatic poise 
that is inborn within the Adept.                         Taking this one step further, we 
understand that the true             A          ∴            A          ∴            is 
represented by the 3 Gods of the 3 chapters of Liber MA:                             Maut, the 
Goddess of Chapter 1                                          = 447                            
Amun, the God of Chapter 2                                                     = 747                
            Khons-pa-Khart, the Child-God of Chapter            3                                   
                              = 447                        Thus, we have 447 + 747 + 447 = 1641, 
which is the Conrune of 825            – Adyton           . Between them lies the Differential of 
816, which is 8 × 102, 102 being the value of AMVNH, which is the Word of the Lauds. If we 
consider 816 as an ordinal of a Prime, the 816            th            Prime is 6271, which is the 
number of words and verse numbers in the Global Sum of Liber MA. The Reversal of this huge Prime is 
another prime, 3797, the 528            th            Prime. This is the side of a square whose 
area is the Global Sum of Liber MA.                        Within this context, we can understand 
that there is a lot going on with these numbers. That is the nature of the Gnosis of the Aeon of 
MA, that there is a mathematical exactitude that transcends what we normally understand to be 
Synchronistic Gematria. To use the ordinal value of a Prime within this context is a testament to 
the higher intelligence through which this system was made to manifest. For 816 + 528 = 1344, and 
this is the sum of the Differentials of the MIX Founding Heptagon, the Order through which the 
Current of the Aeon of MA came into being. And when we MIX these two huge primes together, 6271 
-&gt; 3797 = 1968, which is the rounded value of the Circumcircle of the Psyche Heptagon            
(           whose edge length is 1708           )           . 1968 is the reversal of 656, which is 
the Greek word, “H TEΛETH”, the Initiation. This gives us a Triad Sum of 12036, which is 17 × 
708. 17 is the Triune representing Venus. 708 is the TQ of “           Also the lady Maat with 
her feather and her sword abode to judge the righteous           ”. This represents the 
Adjustment Atu, which is assigned to Libra, ruled by Venus.                         We can then 
consider the Adyton to be the central chamber concealed within the Pyramid, which is symbolic of 
the Queen’s Chamber, or “the Sanctuary of the Hidden Goddess”. It is at the very heart of the 
Pyramid, the heart of our Mysteries. It should           be           not          ed th           
at within the MIX Mysteries, there is no consideration of Outer Order versus Inner Order, it is all 
One Order,           as it is said            “The Way is open to all.”                    825 
as the gematria of Adyton in Greek also points to another mystery found in Seven Spirits: the value 
of the following phrase “          in the skein of the golden coppery leaden silvery mercurial 
tinny and ferric veins         ”.          Through this, we can then represent one of the 7 sides 
of the Adyton with one of the 7 metals. In TQ, these metals equal 534, whose Phi Triplet is 
330:534:864. This is highly significant, as 330 represents the Seed of the AMWN Hexagrams, whose 
divisors equal 864.  It is a rare occurrence in which we find a number whose divisors sum a number 
in Golden Ratio to the number itself. We will see, further down, how we can derive the Greek Vowels 
from this seed of 330.                    Given the importance placed on the Chamber of the Adepts, 
or the Adyton, it calls for us to reinterpret this most precious of Mysteries to align it with the 
Aeon of Amon. We will leave behind many of the concepts and ideas that those Old Aeon orders had 
concerning the Chamber of the Adepts. In full, verse 7 of The Book of Dissolution reads:            
           7. The adyton of the seven is Fire and Ballistic and Wood and Waves.                    
The total for this in TQ         is         625, and this gives us a clue          to         its 
purpose and construction. Firstly, the Φ of 625 is 1011,          and we          find this 
gematria          in Seven         Spirits:                       “           The wayward must 
journey home, their paths will become clear if they vibrate with the light that is their own signal 
in the Eye.          ”                     We can         then         see that one of the 
purposes of the Adyton is to give a home to the wayward, as this idea of the Vault being a home is 
also presented in The Book of Dissolution, verse 46, which reads, in part:                         
It is home to weary wanderers inside its very vault.                   And again, we find this 
concept in The Time of the Trinity:                        “           Make thy home a castle, 
and thy castle a fortress, and thy fortress a bastion and thy bastion a beacon and thy beacon a 
beak and thy beak a beckoner.          ”                    Here we find a TQ value of 1404, 
which is the sum of the letters of the          Three Grades of Liber AL        : Yod – Zain – 
Peh        ,         spelled doubly in full. The Adyton is then the home of the Initiate, weary of 
this world. It is a place of rest and meditation, yet also a place of exploration and discovery. It 
is then designed to be exactly that. It is a place that affirms the Life Force and vibrates with 
the fullness of our Mysteries.                     For the Old Aeon, the Chamber of the Adepts was 
the Tomb of their mythical founder, Christian Rosenkreutz. And much of their symbolism surrounds 
this, including the Pastos, which is the central piece of the Chamber of Adepts. The Ritual of the 
Adeptus Minor is to celebrate the ‘dying’ of the Ego in a carnal sense, and its resurrection 
towards a mo         re          spiritual         ly          attuned         mind set, in 
preparation for the Trial of the Adeptus Exemptus, whose job it is to take on the Abyss. One of the 
salient features of the Adyton is that the idea of the ‘dying god’ is transformed into the 
Charioteer, with the central piece, the Pastos, becoming the Throne of the Charioteer.              
           “           And as the Living Spirit wilt thou come to thy ecstasy as surely as the 
Chariot will come to the Temple of the King          ”                    As to the symbology 
surrounding its construction, we find that the Rerune of 625 is 347, and this is the Hebrew word 
for APRIVN, meaning Chariot. It should be noted that 347 is the 69         th         Prime, and 69 
is the value of           skein        , which in Seven Spirits is composed of the Seven Metals. 
Thus, the Chariot itself is composed of the 7 Metals that          make up         this skein. With 
this         equivalent         of the Chariot, we can then reformulate the Adyton to represent the 
Merkaba         h          (Chariot)          a        nd the Universe in which the Merkabah 
exists. It then is no longer a Tomb, with all its pseudo-Christian symbology.          I have often 
wondered         why the Prophet never reformulated the Chamber of the Adepts according to Thelemic 
symbolism. A commentary does exist, but it escapes me why he never ‘purged’ this particular 
ritual. Perhaps it does exist, and it is a closely guarded secret, but this is doubtful.            
         We are told that the Adyton           IS         “fire, ballistic, wood and waves”. 
This is an interesting take on the 4 traditional elements. The verse itself          points         
towards a ‘four-ness’, being that the differential between 625 and 347 is 278, which in Hebrew 
is ARBOH, the number 4. Further, 625+347 = 972, whose reversal is 4. These “elements” can be 
taken to represent many things. One of them is the 4 states of matter:                        Fire 
= Plasma         Ballistic                 = Gas         Wood = Solid         Waves = Liquid        
             It can also refer to the Alchemical Process of Distillation, where Fire is the heat 
applied, which in turn, turns it into vapor that travels upward into the condensation tube, called 
the serpentine coil condenser, where the vapor is solidified into a liquid.                     
These four elements, which I have come to think of as the Amun Elements, total 206 in TQ.  206 is 
the Conrune of 157, the Φ of 97. The transition of 97 through 206 gives us 69, which as we noted 
above, is the word skein, and that the 69         th         prime is 347, the Chariot. The 
Transitional Sum of this triad is 372, which is the Hebrew word for 7, ShBO. Or we can take the 
phrase “          The adyton of the seven is Fire and Ballistic and Wood and Waves        ” and 
compare the subject to the predicate, giving us ‘         The adyton of the seven        ’ into 
‘         Fire and Ballistic and Wood and Waves        ’ making the Triad          248         
-&gt;          362         =          485        . 485 is 5x97 and is the number of lines in the 
Indestructible Tarot.                          right    492125

note on 206: it is the Converse of 466, which points          toward         another grouping of 
four, namely the 4 Sphinxes.                             It should not be discounted that 466 is 
also the value of           נוית         , NVITh, in Hebrew, the Star Goddess. We find that the 
Φ of 206 is 333, which in TQ, gives us “the message of the star goddess”. This is one of the 
goals of the Adyton, that it represents her message in the form of Geometric Mysteries. One mystery 
is formed herein by the Pythagorean Triangle, for if one Leg is 206, and the other leg is 466, it 
gives us approximately 509, the 97th Prime. 509 points to another grouping of 4 given in the Book 
of Twelve          Ages,          verse          34, in part:                        “           
In the throne room is Juppiter, on a chair carved by hand with the regalia of eagle’s talons and 
lion’s manes and bull’s horns and dolphin’s fins.           ”                      The 
regalia is ‘eagle’s talons, lion’s manes, bull’s horns, and dolphin’s fins’. These 4 
sum to 509.                      Having proven its purpose and intent, we have now come to the 
design aspect of the Adyton. This will be done in 5 parts, as follows:                              
     The Adyton’s shape as a prism of Light, and the importance of Color.                        
The measuring system that will be used for the Adyton.                        The Heptagon of the 
Adyton and its values.                        The Floor          represent         ing          the 
Foundation of our Work, being both the Vehicle and Body of our Mysteries.                        
The Walls representing wher        e this Work takes place: the Starry Abode of your travels. It is 
through          them that         we express the Science and Art of our Magistery.                 
     The Ceiling, representing the Pinnacle and Aim of our Work.                                    
        The Prism of the Adyton                    One of the aspects of the reformulation of the 
Chamber of the Adepts is the use of color. The word “light” appears 26 times in our Holy Books 
and is a clue to how to approach the question of color. The concept of light is dealt with in the 
very beginning of Seven Spirits:                          6. The Star Goddess awaits and attacks 
withdraws and advances into the fabric of your being. She illuminates the emptiness with her rivers 
of light. She gives this number 182 and provides the seven with all they desire                     
     7. She is not on the mountain She is the mountain She is not in the looking glass, she is the 
glass and the light therein.                         8. Heed her call, absorb all of her colors. 
What seems white is a myriad combined, each a strand of her hair, a glimpse of her loveliness.      
              I would call particular attention to verse 8, which implies that white light is a 
myriad combined, and this is what the RGB color scale represents: the more combined and the higher 
the value, the closer you         approach                 pure         White Light. This verse is 
valued at 1063, the 179         th         Prime, for which we have the TQ equivalence “the 
Chariot of the Sun”. The reversal of 1063 is 823, the 143         rd         prime, which needs 
no introduction. Her rivers of light, in this context, would then be the 26 colors of the Trigrams, 
which then become a myriad combined to form the colors of the 728 Ditrunes, which become attributed 
to the Walls. This Light then illumines the emptiness with her loveliness. Remember that we are 
told in the first verse of Seven Spirits:                      “           The entire cosmos is 
discovered through the empty net of the Eye         .”                    It is the Eye the 
perceives Light, or its combinations that give color through its different wavelengths.  So, to 
this end, I have designed what I call the Amun Color Map, based on the Phi Ratios of 97, and 
encoded into a RGB Color coding. This Color Map is particular to the Adyton         coloring and    
     uses color to elucidate certain Mysteries.                          left    top                
                                        The idea behind the Amun Color map was to base it on the 
phi ratios of 97. We have the following step values: 60, 97, 194, and 254. I decided on a limit of 
254 instead of 255. This represents the Pure White Light that is unapproachable. This limit also 
hides 255, because “           Amun is the Concealed One        ”          = 255        . For 
equivalences, we find the following values in TQ:                                       60:         
  Shiny                         97:           Night-sky                194:           this tempered 
white light         254:           the sun-drenched sky                              We can then 
create         a         map of colors from these values. It will be shown later how         they   
      can be used to encode certain color mysteries in the values used for the individual colors 
one may choose to create.                     The Grand Sum of all the numbers used          is     
    10017. This number is 27 x 371. 371 = “           Their plumage is like the peacock in the 
vessel         .        ” This is a reference to a stage in the alchemical process. According to 
the pictures depicted in           Splendor solis                   oder Sonnenglanz        , a 
major alchemical work from the 16         th         century, this stage is ruled by Venus. To 
quote Adam McLean, a prominent authority on such subjects:                   “          With the 
Peacock stage, the alchemist has entered into the inner experience of the astral world, which 
initially appears as ever shifting patterns of colour. This experience is often symbolised in 
alchemy by the image of the peacock's tail with its splendid iridescence of colour        .”      
              The reversal of 10017 is 553, which we find in Seven Spirits:                         
 She is not in the looking glass, she is the glass and the light therein.                           
       What an amazing construction this is. We have 27 Trigrams representing the RGB color 
spectrum, which in turn, we are told, is the very fabric of our Star Goddess. Following this 
lesson, we are instructed:                                        Heed her call, absorb all of her 
colors.                     This phrase is 286, the Reversal of 442, MAAT! If we separate just the 
colors from the gray tones, we get the gray tones as 1053 and the colors as 8964. Amazingly, 8964 
is 12 x 747          = Amu          n         . The reversal of 8964 is 652, whic         h         
 is          equ         al          to the phrase “The light is already there the time is 
already come. Sound is already heard”. 1053 is the reversal of 13, the Sun Triune. When we add 
the reversals, 652+13, we get 665, 97 x Φ          4         , or 5 x 133, the name of Amun in 
Tiferet          on the Tree of Life.                     As previously demonstrated by Frater 
O.L., the colors, when seen in the color wheel, form themselves into 8 sets of Grand Trines, being 
equidistant from each other. These 8 numbers are:

                               In          this pattern, all 8 numbers sum 2988, which is 4x747. 
The first term, 254 is half the          5          th          term, 508. These are attributed to 
the 4 Elements, Sol &amp; Luna. 254+508=762, which is Greek for περιφανεια, which can 
mean “full Knowledge”. Its root means “to appear, appear forth, or shine.” The other 6 
values           ‘surround’ 762, being composed of 6 planets and 12 Zodiac signs. These sum 
2226, which is 7x318; 318 being the value of Helios, Sol. When we t         ransition 762 through 
2226, we get 5877, which is 9x653, an AMWN Hex. Thus, its reversal gives us another AMWN Hex, 575, 
providing a direct AMWN hex pair.                      For these values, we have the following 
equivalences:                                                   254

all directions                                  Having established this color code, we can now keep 
in sight one of the many instructions from The Book of the Crystal and the Peacock:                 
         Light is the message, in all its forms           .                    The Adyton is a 
Vault of seven sides, so the geometry of the Heptagon plays a vital role in our design. The word 
heptagon itself is of Greek origin, επτάγωνο, and equals 1309, which is 7x187. For 187, we 
have the TQ equivalent of “on seven sides.”                     Having been instructed that the 
Adyton is of Seven Sides, we now explore the possibilities of what to do with these seven sides. 
What is amazing is that this can be derived from the colors themselves. Frater O.L.  presented the 
idea of taking the Trigram totals of the 8 Equidistant points on the Color Wheel, and multiplying 
them by 28,         (        which gives a doubling of the values in terms of TQ        )        . 
The chart is as below:                                                   37

=SUM(ABOVE)                 348                                                         =SUM(ABOVE) 
                9744                                                                  The sum of 
the Trigrams is 348, “Mix the fire and the water; all shall dissolve”. The Fire is the warm 
colors, while the Water is the cooler colors. Thus, 348 x 28 = 9744 = 3 x 3248, the Sum of the AMWN 
Hexagrams. Seen another way, 9744 in Ternary is 111100220, which reverses to 22001111, which is 
5872, whose reversal is 111100022 = 3248, the sum of the AMWN Hexagrams. When we transition the 
Warm colors, summing 3612, into the Cool Colors, summing 6132, we gain the transitional result of   
          93           = Thelema.                       We can then see that with the use of Light 
and Color, the Adyton is then a seven-sided Prism, through which Light is distilled. As we know, 
the Walls of the Adyton are represented by the Seven Planets, and the 7 Double Letters of the 
Hebrew Al          phabet          , attributed to those planets,           equal 709. The Reversal 
of 709 is 431, and this is the Greek Word, πρίσμα, prisma          , the root of our English 
word prism.                      431 is the 83           rd           P          rime number. The 
Importance of 83 within this Gnosis cannot be           ov          erstated,           since       
    14 × 83 = 1162, the numeration of Katalysis. (            Note: 14 + 83 = 97!          ) We 
can then proceed on the premise that the Adyton is a seven-sided prism and make certain 
calculations that derive from this. One should note that a seven-sided prism           consists     
      of the following:                       9 Faces, being the 7 sides and the top and bottom.    
                   21 Edges, each edge represented          by          a letter of Liber Carrus    
                   14 Vertices, which can be seen as representing the dual nature of the Double 
Letters attributed to the Planets.                     The simple sum of these 3 numbers is 44, 
which is DLI, the Hebrew word for Aquarius. This word equals 528 in full, and we saw the importance 
of the 528          th          Prime above. The reversal of 44 is 684, which is the Greek word 
‘MΥΣΤΗΡΙΟΝ’,          Mysterion,          counted with a stau.                     If 
we multiply these numbers instead, we obtain 9 × 21 × 14 = 2646. This is an interesting number as 
it is also 7 × 378, 378 being ShBOV in Hebrew, the word for Heptad, and there are many heptads one 
can choose from in our Gnosis. We find this number to reverse to 226, which is a very intriguing 
result.                         In TQ, we find “NU is the breath of what I AM”. This is an 
obvious reference to the MA – I – ON formula. We can transliterate the TQ attributions of these 
letters to Hebrew: English NU is Scorpio and Mars; English AM is Virgo and Aquarius. In Hebrew 
these are the letters Nun + Peh + Yod + Tzaddi = 50 + 80 + 10 + 90 = 230, the Conrune of 133 with 
the 97 Differential.                        In Greek, we find ‘Η ΙΣΗ’, ‘The Equilibrium. 
This is a hidden function of the Star Atu, represented by Aquarius.                        In 
Hebrew, we find the word ‘           צפון         ’, meaning hidden or concealed. And what 
does it conceal? In          f         ull, with finals, this word equals 957, which is Liber 
LUXORAT, A:5:                          “The steeds and the driver, the wheels and the carriage.   
                        Mount thyself in the center for ease of motion.”                    We 
see that the symbology of the seven-sided prism is very important to this Gnosis. We can then apply 
pure math to the prism. Each wall is divided into 13 units per edge, and 8 units in height. This 
gives us 104 squares per wall, so that all 7 total 728 Ditrunes. This fact will be gone over in the 
section on the Planetary Watchtowers. Yet the pure geometry of the Adyton as a prism is as follows: 
                                                                                   This gives us a 
total volume of 4913, which is 17          3         ! 17 is the Venus Trigram, whose orbital 
mechanics are fundamental to the Celestial Geometry of the Adyton. We can also understand this, 
then, as 17 × 289.  289 is the Differential assigned to 15° Cap, placing it on the 185 Heptagon, 
and assigned to the Venusian          wall, or          Watchtower.                     Most 
significantly, as will be shown later, the sum of the Central Columns of the Walls is 133 × 156, 
and 133 + 156 = 289. 133 and 156 form a Perfect Pythagorean Triplet as 133:156:205,          with   
       205 being the Hypotenuse of this Right Triangle.                     There are several ways 
to interpret this, yet it is the cube of the Venus Trigram which emphasizes the importance of Venus 
to this astro-cosmology of the Adyton. Looking at the surface area, we have the Walls          
being          728 and each of the upper and lower Heptagons          having          a surface 
area of 614 each, giving us a total surface area of 1956. This is equivalent to the Secret 
Tetragrammaton Formula of AUMN  MA,          (         see Bulletin 62         )         .          
           Creating a Triad between the surface area and the volume gives us 1956 → 4913 = 3457, 
which is the total of new words (including 1 new verse) of Liber Ma compared to Liber L. This       
   is          the 483          rd          Prime, which is the Hebrew word,            מזלות  
        Mazlot         h          - Constellations, the sphere of the zodiac.          Since        
  this transition is the number of new words in Liber MA, we can see this as the inherent textual 
change from the Aeon of Horus to the Aeon of Ma. 3457 is also the Greek word κινεω in full, 
which means to move, to change or innovate. Liber Ma is assuredly the innovation of Liber L to 
expound the Mysteries of AMOUN.                                  We can then ultimately discover 
the true purpose of the Adyton through the Triad of the word Adyton           itself, and the 
volume that Adyton contains:           825 →4913           =           4111, the 566           th 
          Prime,           and 566 is the gematria of the Hebrew word           TKVN, or 
Restoration.                               Now we can           integra          te           3 key 
concepts through their Triad          s with each other          . We have the following:           
               10017 represent          ing           the fullness of the light spectrum as an RGB 
code based on step values of 97.                           3457 which represents the integration of 
the surface           area           to the volume of the Adyton based on a prism whose edge length 
is 13 and height is 9.                           2646 which represents the multiplication of the 
parts of that Prism.                                   The sum of the three Triads made between 
these values is           37264, which is 17 × 2192. 17, as we saw above, is the basis for the 
volume of the Adyton itself. It is also the Hebrew word            חוּג          , mean         
 ing           to move in a circle or circuit.           2192 is the Hebrew           שמן 
משחת קדש           , ShMN           f           MShChTH QDSh, the Holy Oil of Anointing.     
      Thus,           the combination of Light          ,           in the Prism that is the Adyton 
and its sacred geometry          ,           is an activation of the Holy Anointing Rite within the 
Adyton.                       The Holy Anointing Oil o          f           Amun is composed of     
      7 blended oils as           stated in the Book of Seven Minstrels          . These have a 
value of 1510           (Epistle           23).           Making a           Triad           
between the Hebrew title of such an oil, and the names of those oils:           2192 → 1510 =     
      5166          .           M          aking a Triad of this with 4375, the value of the        
   7           words of the           Anointing,           gives us 5879, the 774           th      
     Prime          .                                 Yet this section is all about the Adyton as a 
          prism of light.           We then take our result of 5879 and           make a Triad      
     with           2988,           (          which represents           the 8 Grand Trines of the 
Amun Color Wheel          )                     and get           19, whose Mystic Number is 190    
      . This reminds us that the primal Triad of Creation is 774→190 =1577, the            value 
of the term ‘          Ain Soph          ’          , representing the           ultimate 
origin of the source of Light within the Adyton.           This is fully revealed           in the 
works of Ome          ga Logion          :           making a Triad of AIN SOPh           (the 
Limitless)           with AVR           (Light) is 1577→          207           =           757   
       , the value of           MAION          .           Thus, the Light comes from the 
Limitless.                        The Cubit of AMUN                      We          can          
now establish a system of measurement for the Adyton. There are a lot of systems out there, from 
metric, imperial, and the more ancient forms, such as cubits. For the Adyton, we will be using the 
royal cubit as the measurement standard. The cubit is basically the measurement of the elbow to the 
fingertips. Thus, everyone has their personal cubit measurement. From this we have, in a royal 
cubit, 7 ‘palms’ and 28 ‘finger breadths’. To celebrate the Magus of the Next Aeon, we 
shall base the length of this cubit on his personal cubit, which is 19 inches. In Hebrew, these 
measurements are known as follows:                         Cubit = AMH (gematria 46) (19 inches 
Imperial)                         Hand-breadth – TPhCh (gematria 97) (2 5/7ths Inches {or 
19/7ths}; 2.714 Imperial)                         Fingerbreadth – AtzBO (gematria 163) (19/28ths 
of an inch; .679 inches Imperial)                      And herein is the beauty of this system. AMH 
= 46, which is also BDIL, Tin, the Metal of Juppiter. When we add the Gematria of all 3 of these 
units together, we sum 306, which is the reversal of 46, the value of Cubit! Lastly, the Converse 
of 46 is 514, which is the sum of the Letters attributed to Juppiter, in Full, in Liber Carrus. Tin 
is the metal of Juppiter.                       97 needs no introduction, and since there are 7 of 
these, we produce 679, whose converse is 133, which can be looked at as the length of 7 Cubits. In 
full, these letters are 922, whose differential with its Conrune, 1601, is 679. To reinforce this 
idea of 7 handbreadths in the Cubit, the Hebrew H-ShBOH, The Seven, is also 922 in full.            
           The final unit, the fingerbreadth is 163, whose reversal is 747. 28 of these produces 
4564, whose Conrune is 2324, twice the value of Katalysis! What an amazing result this is, that the 
Word of the Aeon and the God of the Aeon are concealed within this ancient measuring system.        
               46 + 679 + 4564 gives us 5289, which is 43 x 123.  43 is the Hebrew word MG, Magus, 
while 123 is ChHN HGDVL, High Priest. We have the union of the High Priest and Magus in one Office 
as the regent of the God of the Aeon, AMUN.                       The traditional cubit is normally 
between 20 to 21 inches, so to differentiate this measurement from the traditional Cubit, this unit 
of measurement shall be called a Z’Bit. The Z is valued at 19, while the word bit means a segment 
or part. The Hand-breadth measurement shall be called the I’Bit, as 2 5/7ths (19 7ths) inches is 
69.9 mm, rounding to 70. The I is then a reference to “eye”, which is the letter Ayin, being 
70. The final unit shall be called an A’Bit, because 19x28 = 532, and this is the Greek Letter 
Alpha spelled in full. The first letter of each of these units, ZIA, represent, in Hebrew: Gemini, 
Virgo and Air. All three of these can be attributed to Mercury. As Greek letters, in full, they 
equal 1959. 3 x 1959 = 5877. The number 5877 is the result of the transition, see above, between 
the Luminary and non-Luminary colors. Both numbers are reversals of 575, except the 1959 is a 
Septagram, and 5877 is an Octogram. It           should be noted that this is an esoteric measuring 
system that is applied to the Mysteries of the MIX. The sum of these 3 units, Z’Bit + I’Bit + 
A’Bit, equals 111 in TQ.                                                 The Heptagons of the 
Perimeter                The number 1404, the sum of the letters of the Three Grades, spelled 
doubly in full, shares a very special relationship with 625, which is the value of Dissolution: 7. 
“The adyton of the seven is Fire and Ballistic and Wood and Waves”. When we make the side 
length of a heptagon equivalent to 625, we gain the following results:                              
                                                            When we use 625 as the edge length, the 
long diagonal becomes            1404         ! This is also the value of Liber Graduum, In         
i         t         ium         :70:                         “The Adept has fashioned the jewel 
as a token of mastery, majesty, mystery too. The mark of the Master has facets that focus the Light 
of the Living into the third Eye.”                    This is one of the very functions of the 
Adyton, to focus the Light into the Third Eye, which in occult anatomy, is the Pineal Gland, 
represented by the pinecone. The short diagonal is then represented by 1126, which is the Devil Atu 
in Liber Spectaculi:                          “From West and East the blood is mixed, betwixt the 
two the third is made. And by this Holy Child will come the Silver Star in the heptagon.”         
           We could interpret this West and East as referencing the 2 diagonals, which when 
‘mixed’ produces 740. These are the sum of Series 1 and Series 2 of Liber Carrus, leaving us 
Series 0 whose sum is 747, AMUN, whose differential is 720, the Circumcircle Radius of this very 
Heptagon!                    When we make the Silver Star within this Heptagon, we have (1404.36 × 
5) + (1126.21 × 2) = 9274.2. which we round to 9274. This is 2 × 4637, 4637 being the            
625            th          Prime.                    What is most significant is the perimeter: 
4375, or 7 × 625. In the Book of the Seven Minstrels, we are told:                         “     
       These mark the points of a sigil and bless the Adept with its potency. Use cinnamon or myrrh 
or olive or olibanum sandalwood, acacia, or mint. A combination or a single oil. Bless thyself with 
the words                              Atun Mekhare Saphet Alon                         Teshet 
Noser Tefnut         ”                    We transliterate these letters into Greek, they sum 
4375, the same as the perimeter of this Heptagon.

transition these Seven Words through each other, they sum 11601, which is the Reversal of 1681, 41  
        2         , which can also be seen as MA x MA. Each of these can be seen as a Name for one 
of the Seven Minstrels and attributed to each of the Walls.                     We now look at 625 
as a Ditrune itself, and find that its Conrune is 440, which is the sum of the Seven Metals as they 
are presented in Liber MA. The Atomic Numbers of these same metals add to 393. This is also the 
result of the Transitional Tree of the LUXORAT planetary chapter order as follows:                  
       “The transgrams of this planetary trigram sequence sum to 76 = UNITY, the first word of 
the Book. The Transitional Triads can be continued, using the first set of six Transgrams, and then 
making Triads out of them, etc. The final trigram is Mars, and this is the Ruby set in the Diadem

      117           + 143                       (sum = 393)                    We then take this 
result of 393 and the number of MA squared, 1681, and make a Triad of them to reveal the hidden 
number therein:                   1681 &gt; 393 = 1295                    This reveals to us the 
esoteric dimensions of the Adyton, for 1295 is 7 × 185,          with          185 being the 
Conrune of 97. This reveals the following Heptagon:                                                 
                        To confirm this use of the 185 as the perimeter of the Adyton, we find that 
the Differential of 625&gt;440 to be 185. In terms of Ohm’s Law, 625 would be the Current and 440 
would be the Resistance offered by the Metals. This results in a Voltage of 185. Just as every 
Conrune Pair produces a unique Differential, so does the interaction of Current and Resistance      
    produces                   a                   unique Voltage. Thus, 185 is the Potential 
Difference of 625 and 440.                     There are many attributes of 185 that can be 
detailed herein. As the Conrune of 97, its importance to this Gnosis cannot be extolled enough. 185 
is the TQ of “the ruby of the ark”, and it is this very ruby that is set in the Diadem of the 
Queen, represented by Mars, the finale of the LUXORAT Transition Tree.                     Probably 
the most important fact is that 185 as a radius of a circle gives us a circumference that is 1162, 
Katalysis, the Word of the Aeon of MA; thus, giving us the measurement of the Inner Heptagon. The 
relationship between 1162 and 1295 is shown by making a Triad of these 2 numbers, 1162 -&gt; 1295 = 
822, which is the Hebrew word ShBOThIM, meaning ‘sevenfold’. In this, we know that the English 
word “sevenfold” equals 133, the number of our Current         , and the difference between 
1162 and 1295.          133 -&gt; 822 = 1595, which is 5 × 319, AMUN spelt in full. Its Conrune is 
919, the Differential of 1162&gt;2081, and the 157          th          Prime, 157 being the Φ of 
97.                     The Transgram of 822 verifies the heptagonal scheme, as 822 is also the 
spelling of the Hebrew letter name Zayin, in full, with sophits. This also has the regular value of 
7. With the sevenfold scheme in mind, we shall now examine some of the salient features of the 
Adyton whose edge length is 185.                      Rounding the values of the diagonals, we have 
416 for the long diagonal and 333 for the short diagonal.                          416 = “Recover 
          the                   beauty and delight in creation”                        333 = 
“the           message          s                    of the star goddess”                       
 333 -&gt; 416 = 253, the Mystic Number of 22, the Jupiter Triune. “the affirmation of His 
Unity”                    Encoded in this is a very special instruction. First, we are told that 
this heptagon is a message from the Star Goddess, and that by its geometry, we can recover beauty 
and delight. The Transgram reveals the purpose, to affirm His Unity. It should be noted that Unity 
is the opening statement of Liber LUXORAT.                     Now we take this Heptagon and draw 
therein the 3 Sacred Stars of our Order, the Star of Lamed (known vulgarly as the Star of Venus), 
the Star of Babalamun (known vulgarly as the Star of Babalon), and the Silver Star, the star that 
is particular to our Order.                     The Star of Lamed uses the Long Diagonals of the 
185 Heptagon. 7 × 415.691 = 2909.837, rounding to 2910. This number is 30 (Lamed) × 97 (Amun). 
Its Prime Factors sum 107, MA-ION (2 × 3 × 5 × 97). The sum of its proper divisors (σ(n)), is 
7056, 7 × 1008. 1008 is the TQ value of Liber MA 3:9:                   “Rest! Be strong! 
Restore them! such are the Ways of the Method of Healing; thus shall the hospice be the place of 
healing arts.”                    The Adyton is assuredly a place of rest, and a place where the 
healing of Tikkun can be put into practice. As a number, 2910 has an Abundance of 2136, which is 
the Edge Length of a heptagon whose area is the Global Character Count of the Holy Book of MIX.     
                The Star of Babal         on          has a length that is 7 × 333.358 = 2333.506, 
rounded to 2334. This number is the Rerune of 1162! Because we are reversing the order of the lines 
from an Octogram to a Septagram, it provides a unique Reversal Differential of 1172, which is from 
Liber L, 1:63 –                           Sing the rapturous love-song unto me! Burn to me 
perfumes! Wear to me jewels! Drink to me, for I love you! I love you!                    One last 
star to examine is the Silver Star, which is (5 × 415.691) + (2 × 333.358) = 2078.455 + 666.716 = 
2078 + 667 = 2745.          This is 3 ×          915         , the value of          Liber M       
  A          1: 3 &amp; 4         , as follows –                          3. Every star and every 
planet              is              a whole.                                      4. Every beauty 
is permanent, there is one immanence.                    This is the Conrune of          4653, 
which is 3 × 1511, whi         ch is the value of Twelve Ages         :          30 –            
         Each thread another breath of the ever-moving wind of Amun, spun like a fine spider silk 
to hang from and pull together and capture the moving face of eternity.                   We then 
see in the Reversal of          2745 ↓ 677, which is Liber MA          3: 49          –         
                 Amun is the eagle’s fourfold word            , the cherubim guarding him in all 
ways.                   Upon close examination of this verse         , we see that it totals 677, 
but it is split          as:                    335 = Amun is the eagle’s fourfold word           
      332 =          the cherubim guarding all ways to him.                    These are both the 
Conrune and Differential of 667         .          So,          we          find that this verse 
“sets” below the          2745 and 1551.          Another thing of note is that          2745 
as the Lovely Star whose          5 long diagonals equal 2078 and the          2 sho         r      
   t diagona         ls equal 667. 2708 is the          difference of 2745 – 667.           
Within the channeled works of MIX, we find the following          equivalents to 2078 –           
           Amun will be shown to the people Did you think it an accident that the greatest grave of 
the pharaohs was undisturbed No It was kept concealed as I am concealed so that the name of Amun 
would be revealed again to the generations                     You must travel inward to find the 
precious stone the fruit of the vine branch the stone of the wise Amun is the hidden and will 
always be so Amun is where all power originates the seedbed of the fluctuations in the cosmos       
   .                     This is a major nexus         , for we see here that the Lovely Star, 
created by the 185           heptagon          , can be called the Silver Star of Am         o      
   un         ,                   το           Αστρον                     Αργον        
             του           ΆΜΟΥΝ.          The          fact that the sum of the 5 long 
diagonals is the          Reversal Differential          between          the sum of the 2 sho      
   rt          diagonals and the          sum of the 7 diagonals together is a very rare          
occurrence. It all centers around Am         o         un.                     Here we can make a 
Triad of the Lovely Star a         nd          AMOVN in full as 1099         :          2745 →    
      1099 = 6014, which is          2 × 31 × 97         , or 31 × 194, TzDQ         , and thus  
       :                             אל-צדק                    The God of the Right         
eous                          The           q          uestion is how we deal with these Stars 
symbolically within the Heptagon of 1295. For this, we must turn to the understanding of the Star 
of Lamed. We must remember that the Star of Venus within the Adyton generates the number 2910, and 
this is 30 × 97. 30 + 97 = 127, which is the password Amondieux. 30 is the value of the Lamed. In 
full, 97 as Amun is 319 and Lamed is 74. These sum 393, which is the sum of the Atomic Numbers of 
the Metals.  Above we saw how MA × MA through the Atomic Number sum gave us the perimeter of the 
Adyton as 1295. In this case, we make a Triad of 127, the Password, and the Atomic Number sum, 393, 
and gain 572, which is the M Triune over the A Triune, giving us the glyph of MA as a Ditrune.      
                     Below are the diagrams of the Star of Lamed, one with the Hebrew Letters, the 
other with the attributes of those letters. The key is understanding the 3 levels of attributes. We 
start with Lamed in the Center. Next is the astrological signs, Aquarius to Leo.           The      
     thir          d level w          ould be the Planets. Lastly comes with what remains          
:           4 signs and the 3 Mother Letters. There are several other ways in which we can 
categorize these groupings, but these 3 are what concern us most.                                   
                                                                                                    
                                                            A                                 B     
                            Diff Trans                                      225                     
            709                                 482                                      709        
                         531                                 581                                    
  531                                 225                                 324                       
      Working with the sum of the Letters of each level, we can tabulate the following Triads. The 
sum of these triads is 1387. 1387 is Liber 813 1:6 --                      “            Thou hast 
appeared unto me as a young and brilliant God, a god of music  and beauty, even as a young god in 
his strength, playing upon the lyre.”                          Later in this essay we will see 
how the constellation of the Lyre played a very important role in the founding of the MIX. In the 
Tarot of Amun, this verse is attributed to the Lovers Atu, whose ternary is 485, 5 × 97. It should 
also be noted that the original Lyre had 7 strings.                           Having attained 1387, 
we make a triad with it through the value of the Center, Lamed, thus attaining the Numerical 
Quintessence of these Triads as it pertains to these 3 levels. This Triad is 1387 -&gt; 30 = 1862, 
14 × 133. Or O AION           +           AMM          ON,           thus           The AION of 
AMMON.                           The Conrune Pairing of 1862 is 1417, which is Hebrew, ADVN         
  F           OVLM           F          , Lord of the Universe, truly an apt description of AMMON. 
The Differential is 445, which is Liber Trochos:2 –                                “The stone 
of the philosophers is none other than me.”                          We then see           the 
synthesis           of Ammon, as Lord of the Universe, and as the Stone of the Philosophers. There 
are 2 Triads left to examine that will bring us to the pith of the Star of Lamed within the Adyton. 
The Perimeter is 1295 and represents the outer bounds of the Adyton. All the symbolism and activity 
of the Adyton occurs within this boundary. To understand the relationship of the Star of Lamed to 
the Adyton, we make a Triad of 1295 -&gt; 1862 = 242 – “             The Crown hath seven rays  
        ”. And what are these seven rays? This is hidden in the reversal of 242, which is 726. 
726 is the value of the 7-lettered acronym, V.I.T.R.I.O.L., using Hebrew letters. Each Ray could 
then represent a letter of this word, representing the Alchemical process within the vault itself.  
                         This           word           is rife with symbolism and will be left to 
the individual adept to study. These letters as Trigrams and transitioned though each other give us 
7 Transitions which equal 124, which in TQ, can be “             your holy place          ”. 
Its reversal gives us 444, the value of MQDSh, meaning Sanctuary. This can be considered the Hebrew 
equivalent to the word Adyton. These 2 words, from 2 different languages,            synonymous to 
each other give us the following Triad: 825 -&gt; 444 = 2007,           which           is the 
Reversal of 143, being the Key Amun Hexagram of the Amun Ma           arrangement of the Fourfold 
Word.                           Working the same process of the letters in full, we form a Triad    
      :                     (937 →           1216 → 2020) = 1995, which equals           15 ×  
         133          .           This is the Taurus Trigram           and the 7 Planetary Trigra   
       m.           This can be seen as the Hi          erophant           teaching           the 
Mysteries of the 7 Holy Mountains.           We then           form           the next           
Triad           through                     Lamed,           1995           → 74           =      
     994          , which           the TQ of Twelve Ages: 50 –                               In 
her beckoning is stillness                                     In her reckoning is grace            
  And the fruit of all her labors                                     Is a steady state of grace    
                      The imagery of “stillness” and “grace” evokes a profound           
sense of           peace and balance in the Adepts presence and actions.           The "steady 
state of grace" means a constant, unchanging state of nobility and elegance, showing a           
flawless state           of awareness           that is Sam          hadi. This is the level of awa 
         reness that                     is evoked by the activation of the 3           rd          
 Eye in context to the Adept represent          ed as the Pyramidion.                           994 
is the Reversal of 1138          , and           this is Seven Minstrels          : 21 –          
                       Take oil that has been consecrated and make seven marks for the chakras and 
limbs. Forehead, throat,               heart, &amp;               elbows &amp; knees.               
                         Above we sa          w           the role of the Holy           Anointing 
Oil, and here we f          i          nd           instructions of what to do with this Oi         
 l.           We can then say that           the 7 Marks           are           an acceptance of 
the           “steady state of grace”.           Just as we           made the last Triad 
before, we make a Triad of           994 → 1295 =             774          , the Seed of the Ain 
Soph.                           Here we           look at the normal letters           giving us 
242, “the Crown hath seven rays”          , while the letters in full give us 774          , 
which is the TQ of           “it is graven on the Disk that spins in eternal syncopation aligned 
ever with the Word”          .           242 → 774 = 1561, the Diameter of           a Circle 
whose value is 4904,             Katalysis           in full!                          We then add 
together 242 + 774 = 1016, and this is           Kether spelt in full, and is the Crown that has 7 
Ra          ys.           These           7 Rays are the 7 Planets as evidenced by the Conrune of 
1016 which is 2020, the           7 planetary letters in full          , which form          s      
     the Star of Venus           inside the           Star of Lamed.                     The        
   Crown, in one sense, can be seen as the Ceiling of the           Vault since           the Ceili 
         ng of the Adyton is represented by the Star of Lamed.           The Triad of           242 
and 774 gives us the diameter of the Disk           whose spin           is aligned to the Word of 
the Aeon.           The           syncopation can be seen as the Crown           (Kether)           
dividing itself into           242 and 774, which only occurs when we compare letters in the        
  ir           simple value to letters in the          ir           value in full.           We 
then make a final triad of           1016 → 1561 = 702, which is Liber Ma 3          :53          
 –                                With my disk I light up the path of the Hierophant and the 
Priestess, Magus and Death.                          Again, we find the symbolism of the Disk       
   .           If we look at the value of th          e letters attributed to these cards in full, 
we have           12 + 73 + 412 + 756 = 1253.           This is the value           o          f 
the Greek word           αληθεύω          , which means           “to speak the truth”   
       . As we read in Liber Ma 1:42 –                                 May you see with grace the 
fountainhead sound and flowing. So with thy lauds; thou hast no right but to speak the truth        
     .                                                 The Floor                          The Floor 
of the Adyton represents the foundation of our Work. It is the operative aspect of the symbolism of 
Sanctuary. As such, we will begin with the Inner Heptagon that delineates our work          ;       
    that is the Heptagon of Katalysis.                               -149902    5896818             
                                             This is the first layer of meaning as we journey 
toward the center. We first encounter the Greek Vowels. These total 1294. To understand the 
relationship between 1294 and 1295 we must turn to the mystery of Music. Each vowel is represented 
by a string on the Lyre, the patron constellation of the MIX.  The idea is that the 7 Notes of the 
scale are not a complete Octave. It must complete itself, the 1 that started the scale must be 
repeated, thus concluding the Octave. As it says in ancient text –           “          The one 
ran and returned          ”          . This whole idea can be applied to the musical Octave. We 
then have the 1294 of the Greek vowels, and returning adds another 1,           making           
the 1295 of the Perimeter.                      Looking at the quadset of 1294, it reveals many 
mysteries.                                                           A                              
     1742                                   1294                                       B

                                 1438                                       D                       
          376                                 277                                 7389              
                    We start with the reversal of 1742, which is 1814, which          is          
the Hebrew          p         hrase ‘פְרִי-עֵץ, זֹרֵעַ זָרַע’, ‘the fruit 
of a tree yielding seed’. The tree which is yielding the seed is then represented by 1742, OTz 
HDOTh TVB VRO,                   ‘the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and evil’.          This    
      total         s          3556, which is 7×508, the TQ of the first verse of            
Dissolution         .                       Thus, we find that the Tree of the Knowledge of Good 
and Evil is the Conrune of the Seven Sacred vowels that form the perimeter of the Adyton. Perhaps 
one way to view these seeds of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil is as these Seven Sacred 
Vowels, “           the seven seeds of the Plough         ”. And the reversal of 1294 is 1438, 
the Seeds of the AWMN Hexagrams when transliterated into Hebrew.                       Further 
examination of this Quadset reveals 277 as the Differential Transgram. 277 is the TQ of “         
  the perimeter of your Vault         ”. Again, the precision of our Gnosis is beyond         
reproach. The Septenary, 7389, is a very special number. As 74 times this number is 546786, the 
simple sums of the Global Sum of Liber L            and         Liber MA.         The fact that     
    we can attain the simple addition of these 2 works is         miraculous.         This number 
represents 74, Lamed in Full         multiplied by 7389        .                 7389 is 9         
× 821, the 142         nd         Prime.                                           Now let us 
consider some of the ramifications of using the 7 Greek vowels. Using their           alphabetical  
         sequence, we tabulate the sevenfold transitions of the simple value of the Letters:

1506                             The sum of the Transgrams is 4438, which is 7 × 634. This is the 
value of Dissolution:55 –              “As each cycle completes, it is time for con-temp-lation 
of another facet of this jewel.”                          The cycle is then completed by the 
returning of the One. The multiplicand of 7 is a Key. Later in this dissertation, it will be shown 
how 292 dwells within the Heart of the Adyton. Taking 634 as a completion of 7 steps, we draw 634 
towards the center represented by 292, and their interaction makes a Triad with 166, which is the 
edge length of the Inner Katalysis Hept          agon.           Symbolically,           that       
    the vowels dwell within the space between the 1162 and 1295 Heptagons, creating a polygon ring 
between them. The area of this polygon ring is 24235 which is 131 × 185, the edge length of the 
Perimeter times the Key Word             INVIGORATED          .                           Much has 
already been written about the Katalysis Heptagon, and I feel no need to add to the corpus of work. 
Ultimately, our key numbers are 1162, 1295, and 4438. Each of these are divisible                   
    by           7. We can then make the following chart to reflect the 7 within this Triad of 
numbers:                                                       7

                                       7                                       185                  
                     90                                             7                               
        634                                       451                             We gain a Triad 
sum o          f 623, the           gematria           of the           first verse ever 
transmitted: Seven Spirits: 1 –                               “             The entire cosmos 
is discovered through the empty net of the Eye             ”                          And as one 
last transition, 7 -&gt; 623 = 435, the Reversal of 97, AMUN. The use of 1162 and 1295 also puts us 
on the Heptagonal arrangement of the Zodiac. These are as follows:                                  
                                                               First, it should be noted that the 
Control Numbers of these 2 heptagons are 166 &amp; 18          5          , which sum 351, the 
Mystical Number of 26, attributed to Luna. We already know that the Sum of the differentials give 
us the Adyton Polygon Ring. The sum of the Ditrunes involved is 9741, which can be seen 
symbolically as the Hidden God of the Current, Amun as 97, and the name of the Aeon, MA as 41.      
                     On the 185 Heptagon, the Ditrunes equal 5397 and on the 166 Heptagon, the 
Ditrunes equal 4344. To understand their interaction, we make a Triad out of them, 5397 -&gt; 4344 
= 132.  132 is the TQ value of             Dissolution          . Dissolution is the title of Atu 
XIX of the Indestructible Tarot, with a Ternary value of 634, whose value was shown above. Within 
this verse is “con-temp-lation”, which also equals 132.                           Within the 
area of the 1162 Heptagon are the Three Adornments of the Adyton, being the Throne of the 
Charioteer, the Pillars of the Sphinxes, and the Cubical Altar. There is a common theme of 
four-ness, which can be represented as follows:                                                     
                 Fire                                      Throne                                   
   Will of the Adept                                            Air                                 
     Pillars                                      Stance of the Adept                               
             Water                                      Altar                                      
Mark of the Adept                                            Earth                                  
    Floor                                      Path of the Adept                             The 
interaction of the 4 and 7 is highly symbolic in the Adyton, as 4 -&gt; 7 = 1, Unity. We will start 
with the center and work our way out in describing the fascinating and syncretic symbology of the 
Floor.                                        The Throne                    The Throne of the 
Charioteer is the place where we physically sit while in the Adept Chamber. Its design is a 
truncated tetrahedron, with one point aligned to the          central column of the central Wall    
     .          Each side          is colored according to the CMYK color code. These are the 
Subtractive Colors which, as will be seen, complement the RGB of the 4 Totems. Also, as taught by 
Frater O.L., in his commentary o         n          Chapter 2 of Liber MA, these can also represent 
the 3 Gods of Liber MA. The value of these colors, when added together, sums to 1524. Its Conrune 
is 780, the value of Ayin in full. This gives us the Differential of 744, which is AMUN-RE-MAAT, 
(see my essay on 744)                    As a truncated tetrahedron, it represents the Netzach 
Tetrahedron truncated at the 3          rd          level, leaving 4 levels revealed. Because the 
measurements of the Throne are based on the phi ratios of the individual Adept, the apex of the 
Tetrahedron should be aligned to the Adept’s Pineal Gland, thus activating it with 319. Volumes 
could be written about this gland. Besides the multitude of information available in our writings 
on the number 319, in TQ it is also the gematria of “all one continuous flow of the Chariot”.   
                  The base of the spine would then be aligned to the Apex of the inner tetrahedron, 
which is 292, “            the seven seeds of the Plough         ”.  This would then give us 
the following transitional Triad, representing the flow of energy from the base of the spine to the 
pineal gland: 292 -&gt; 319 = 265! The number 265 is the value of the Ditrune attributed to the 
empty verse of Liber Luxorat. 265 in TQ is “these seven ways are one”. One way to see these is 
that since the Walls are the area of our work, and there are 7 of them, each of their ‘ways’ 
are still but 1 way, expressed via 7 modes.                     Taking the Throne as a whole, the 
total of the 4 layers of the Genesis Tetrahedron is 32049 = 39 x 831. We can look at this as 39 
being the sum of the Trigrams forming the Perimeter of the Vault. 831 is Aleph in full, with 
sophit. Yet it is also the value of Liber Kataluma: 20:                             “Let the 
power of Ma’at course through your veins Your blood transmuted into wine.”                      
                Close attention should be given to the spelling of Maat as Ma’at. This can be 
transliterated into Hebrew as MOTh, equaling 510, and is the same as the Hebrew word          
Yashar            ישר         , meaning to be upright, lawful or to make straight or smooth. 
Thus, Yash          ar           is           M         aat in action, as the definition of this 
word is synonymous to the idea of the moral and ethical conduct of the Maatian          Virtues     
    . This is evidenced by the 42 Negative confessions in the Hall of Truth when the Heart is 
weighed against the Feather of Maat.                                           4121422    10795

Tetrahedron then represent the Adept, consisting of 10 spheres. These spheres sum 4179, which is 
the circumference of a circle whose diameter is          1330.2, round         ed          to       
   1330. This is an unexpected result, as this is the name of Amun in Kether, thus representing the 
Crown, or Amun in his most rarified form. 4179 is itself 7×597 and 597 in Greek is 
ἠγίασμένοις - Hagiasmenois, which means sanctified. This can then be seen as a 
reference to the Anointing Rite and becoming the sanctified of Amun.

is the upper Tetrahedron formed by the 3 layers, and the numbers attributed to its corners. As we 
know, the apex of the tetrahedron is 319, Amun in full. The base of this tetrahedron is formed by   
       323, 453, and 372. These form the skeletal structure in which the remaining six spheres of 
the top three layers rest        , called the Resting Six.         These four numbers then sum 
1467, the Conrune of 747!                     We can also understand this according to the flow of 
energy, from the base points to the apex, and we do this through transitioning each base point 
through 319.                        -&gt; 323 = 315                      319 -&gt; 453 = 347        
              319 -&gt; 372 = 428                    These 3         tot        al 1090, which is 
Chronos in Greek. It has been well proven that Amun is Time. The inner 6 that rest within          
the         4 points equal 2712. This is 6×452, which equals, in Hebrew, SRN HAVPhN, Axle of the 
Wheel, or as vector points on a cube.  We read, then, in Liber MA, 2:7,                           
“I am the axis now concealed, from the cube to the circle”                     It should be 
noted that the TQ of this phrase is 430, the value of the word ShPN, meaning ‘concealed’. The 
Wheel, in this context, is represented by the diameter of 1330. The cube is essentially concealed 
because it is a 3-dimensional figure, while a circle is only 2-dimensional.                     
Looking deeper into this        ,         we can form transitional         triads for the 4 faces 
of this tetrahedron, which will be called the         Pyramidion        .         We find that the 
total of the Transitions of the base         is 1058, which is         Bab        -Al-Amoun-Ra      
  .         The face consisting of (319         -         453         -         372) forms 1066, 
this is         not only 319 + 747, or Amun + Amun in full, it is also           המאור 
הקטן         , the Lesser Light, i.e., the Moon, which          rules 319 as Cancer,           
סרטן         .          It should be          noted that          Sarton, Cancer,          a    
     s 969         , is also Amun          spelled          in full         . This          
highlights          the identity of the          hidden          god          of the Charioteer     
     as          AMUN.                      We then add the other 2 sides together and sum          
2172         , which is the binary sum of the          Tarot of Amun.          Forming a Triad of 
1066 → 2172 = 41, MA!                   The total Transitional Sum of this Pyramidion is then     
     4296, which is 3 × 1432, which is          Liber L          –                            I 
am unique &amp; conqueror. I am not of the slaves that perish. Be they damned &amp; dead!           
              Amen. (This is of the 4: there is a fifth who is invisible, &amp; therein am I as a 
babe in an egg.)                      This verse was highly significant          in developing the 
I – am – un formula when the MIX first started         .          The Reversal of 4296          
is 808          –                   ΕΓΩ, the          individual identity of Adept         .   
       We can then simply add these 2 together          – 4296 + 808 = 5104, which is 8 × 319    
     . This would be           Cheth           combined with           Cancer          , its sign   
       .                       The six hexagrams, or resting points, within this tetrahedron have a 
sum of 2712. Of these six spheres, the key is 452. Its reversal is 556, which is the last 11 words 
of Liber Ma,                         “The Book of the Lauds is Hidden and Revealed. Aumn. Ma      
     .           ”                      Further, since 2712 is 6×452, we will look at the 
geometry of 452 as the edge length of a hexagon. And we are not disappointed. The Hexagram is 
formed by the short diagonals of the hexagon, and this hexagon has a short diagonal of 782.887, so 
rounding to 783 –            BABALAMUN         !                    If we then understand that 
the 4 points of this tetrahedron represent the Four Gates, we can then see BabalAmun as the Goddess 
dwelling in the alcove beyond these Gates.          T         he ultimate integration          is   
       in the transition between these 4 gates and the 6 inner numbers         :          1467 
-&gt; 2712 = 5415, the Conrune of           4179. So there exists a perfect balance between these 
two aspects of this tetrahedron. This balance is maintained by the differential of 5415&gt;4179 
which is 1236, which in turn is the Reversal of 412, the letter Beth, being Mercury and the 
Magician. And to borrow from the Holy Books of Thelema, we find for 412, “The queen of all of 
them that are pure upon earth.” Yet there exists another key in looking at the reversals of this 
Conrune Pair, as follows:                                                          A                
                     4179                                     5415                                  
       B                                   1236                                               C     
                                1321                                     1877                       
                  D                                   556                       The Reversal 
Differential is 556, the Reversal of           452        !                  As for                 
 5415, we find that its Reversal is 1877, and this is the 288         th         Prime. We find the 
Apex of the Tetrahedron to be 319, and the 288         th         Prime hidden in the Transition of 
the 4 Corners and the 6 Resting within these Corners. 288 and 319 reference a very special 
Heptagon, one whose area is the Global Sum of Liber MA. 319 is the Circumcircle radius, while 288 
is the         I        ncircle radius of this Liber MA Global Sum Heptagon.                      
It must be remembered that this Hidden Tetrahedron represents the Adept, thus we have 319 as the 
Crown, combined with the Resting                 Six                  spheres         representing, 
if you will, the 7 Chakras, or points of energy within the subtle b         ody of the Adept. When 
we transliterate the astrological attributes of Triunes into Hebrew, the Resting Six sum 776, which 
is 8×97. The Crown transliterates its Triunes into 50.          The Triad of          50 -&gt; 776 
= 1511. 1511 is Twelve Ages          verse          30:                          “Each thread 
another breath of the ever-moving wind of Amun, spun like a fine spider silk to hang from and pull 
together and capture the moving face of eternity.”                    It is here that we must 
paus        e         and         examine         these 7         orbs         as the idea of the 7 
chakr        as within the Greek language.                 The simple sum of these 7 is 3031        
, which is         7 × 433. 433         is the         84         th         Prime, and there are 
84 aspects involved with the         Tetrahedron of Netzach, the basis of the Throne of the 
Charioteer.         We find that the TQ of 433 is         “the Pyramid of the ceremony of the 
Death of Asar”.         433         in ternary is 121001, so that adding         a yang line to 
make it a septagram gives us 1121001 = 1162!                    The Pyramidion         consists     
    of 10 Aspects        ;         removing 7 of them to represent the Chakr        as,          
leaves                   three                  Aspects that are         323, 3        72, and 453  
      . These sum 1148, which is also the number which reflects the         Altar        ,         
shown         below.         1148 is also         the Greek word Μυστησ        , meaning      
   an         Initiate        .                     Yet we cannot just arbitrarily introduce the 
Chakras         into the Adyton as the Pyramidion without a         numerical                 p     
    roof          for          do         ing          so.          Abov        e we s        ee    
     the         440&gt;625 Conrune pair giving us 185 as a differential        .         The       
  leap         to         the         Cha        k        r        as comes through the Reversal 
Conrune pair         which is         664 &gt;         347 with a differential of 317.         440 
is t        he Hebrew word           לקדוש         , meaning to make holy or          sanctify 
        ; it is also                   the 7 Metals of          Liber MA.          Its Reversal is 
664         ,          which is the Hebrew word           במרכבת          meaning “in a 
chariot”         . In combining these 2 words, we                   have                    
לקדוש                    במרכבת                   meaning          “in a chariot to 
sanctify” or “         in a chariot for holiness”.          We can then say that within       
   the Adyton, we dwell in a chariot          to sanctify. Yet what is                     it       
   we are sanctifying? This is shown to us by the difference of          664 – 440 = 224, which 
is          the Hebrew word           דרך                   which          means “way” in 
English. It denote         s          the path in which you travel in life.          This can be an 
interpretation of Kataluma: 10 –                            Over the cobblestones the Chariot 
rolls                         To the distant temple along                         The Way           
                Bearing the image of the God                         Burnished with finest gold     
                      Beaming in the sunlight                         Dazzling the eyes of the 
devotees.                     T        his verse is         1752        ;                 making    
     a Triad with         4296, the Transitional sum of the Pyramidion,         1752 → 4296 = 
5976, the sum of the         Chakra         names         in Greek.         5976         =         
8 × 747. 8 being the         letter of the         Chariot                 be        aring

he difference                 is         5536, and this is         4 ×         1384        , 
Αποκαταστασισ – Apokatastasis – Restoration, Tikkun.         Thus, to         
Sanctify (440) the Seven Chakras (5976) though         apokatastasis (1384)        .         The 
multiplicand of 4 represents the         Four Pillars that surround the Throne.                 
Armed with this knowledge, we can proceed to examine the         7         Chakras        , whose 
Greek names are ultimately         derived         from Plato in his           Timeaus        . We 
can form the following chart:

to the individual adept         to engage with their own understanding of the Cha        k        r 
       a system        . Cha        kras are specifically mentioned in our Holy Books        .      
   The first use is in the Book of         Seven Minstrels, marking the forehead, throat and heart 
points.         These sum 3003,         which is the value of the Greek word Gnosis in full.        
             Th        e remaining 4         sum 2973, and this is the Reversal of 895        , 
Kataluma: 29 –                          Accept your anointing and be pulled along your course, 
like the Chariot making its way to the temple.                   It should be noted that this is 
the Differential of 1138&gt;2033, 1138 being the valu        e of the verse that first mentions the 
chakras and these 3 points.         Making a Triad of         3003 →         2973 = 3105        . 
        This is the Reversal of 139 – “the central Chakra        ”        . This is 
referenced in         Thirteen Lions –                          And so too does the heart power 
you from within, and so too must it be grasped and captured and its magnificence harnessed to the 
car of your chariot. There is the graal.              The central chakra            It beams as it 
beats. It chimes as it shines. Awaken it and you will be all aglow.                    The subject 
of the numerical aspects and correspondences of the Chakras are beyond the scope of the present 
essay; herein, I will only         express what is related to the Adyton.         Here we make a 
Transitional Series of the individual         Chakra names and the         7 numbers of the 
Pyramidion. These are as follows:

9809        , which is 17 × 577. 17, as we know, is the Venus Trigram. 577 was introduced in the 
very beginning of the         present work as “the Sanctuary of the Hidden Goddess”. Yet what 
is amazing is that the         differential of this number is         9797! We shall return to this 
        later        .                 Each of these chakras is also re        presented by a vowel 
from the Greek Alphabet        . From this, we form a         Transitional Series as follows:       
                                                    1098                                    800

                         860                                    10

                        472                                          333                            
        5                                    673                                          930       
                             1                                    1619                       The 
sum of these Transitions is 9797        !         Thus,         the sum of the names transitioned 
through the         value of the letter        s         used to represent them         is         
9797         which         i        n turn         is         the differential of the names         
transitioned through the 7 numbers in the Pyramidion used to represent         those 7 chakras      
  .         We can then         sum 1294 + 5676 =         7270, which is 10 × 727, the TQ of       
  “the skein of the golden coppery leaden silvery mercurial tinny and ferric”, the seven metals 
as listed in Seven Spirits.         We then can         take         that sum and make the 
following Triad: 7270 → 9797 =         12357. This is then 3 × 4179, the value of all 10 Aspects 
of the Pyramidion.                      Having defined the Hidden Tetrahedron of the Adept, we will 
now examine the Throne itself. The sum of this Tetrahedron, after concealing the upper 3 layers,    
      i.e.,         the sum of the bottom 4 layers, is 31997, which is 7×7×653. We can basically 
spell the name Annu from this arrangement. Annu is an accepted variant spelling of Heliopolis, the 
city of the Sun, from Egyptian inscriptions. Yet what concerns us most, at present, is the 4        
 th         layer of the tetrahedron, upon which the Adept sits while          in         the 
Adyton        .                    This is the upper layer of the Throne,          upon which       
           the Adepts sits in their asana of con-temp-lation. It totals 5357, which is 11×487. 
Just as the Hidden Tetrahedron is a form of a tetractys, so is this layer. And when we compare the 
two through a transition, 4179 -&gt; 5357 = 61        , which is         the Hebrew word ANI, 
meaning “I” or myself        , which is synonymous to the Greek word EGO.         Thus, the 
distinctive power of the Adept is based on a duality of what they are within themselves, (the 
Hidden Tetrahedron), and the foundation through which this is expressed, being the Throne. In full, 
ANI equals 237, which equals in TQ, “          the outpost of the Charioteer        ”, and is a 
AWMN Hexagram. As the Adept sits in          their         asana on the          Thron         e,   
       the          sp        ine becomes aligned to 292, which is Linea Virdis Gyrat Universa, 
“the green line that encompasses the World”. Taking the initial letters of each of these words 
forms two Ditrunes as follows:                     v V                      u U                    
l L                      g G                    595                                   686           
         The sum of these is 128        1 =         21×61, 61 being the Self, the Charioteer, and 
21 being the outpost of the 21 letters forming Liber Carrus. The Reversal of 1281 is 385, Shekinah. 
It is she whose circumference is the Green Line. And who is Shekinah? - “the pure one who dances 
among the stars” (385).                             T         ransition         ing          595 
through 686,          becomes          531, the sum of the outer seven letters attributed to the 
Star of Lamed. In this there are the 3 Mother          Letters,          and 4 Simple letters 
attributed to the Zodiac. This idea can be applied to the 3:4 split of the 7 layers of the 
Tetrahedron. The 3 mother letters          are          the Hidden Tetrahedron         ;          
the zodiacal letters          are          the Throne itself. The sum of the Zodiacal letters is 
190,          which          is the reversal of 774, the Seed of the Ain Soph Aur.          These   
       two form a triad with 561         ,          Ditzaniotah, Concealed Mystery.                 
    Just as we divided the Hidden Tetractys into 2 parts, so shall we divide this into its 
equivocal parts. First is the outer points and the center, which add to 2112        .         The 
Inner Six add to 3245        .         When we transition 2112-&gt; 3245, we get 4375. This is 
7×625, which is the value of Dissolution:7. This was commented on above. We have the verse number 
multiplied by the verse value. 7 + 625 = 632, which is the value of MAUT, spelled in full. The 
difference         between         these         3245 and 2112         is 1133, Liber Concluded: 
33:                               “           This is the real world; its reflection into the 
physical is the plinth on which to rest the world-elephant. It shows only a few of the many 
attributes.”                         -85725    5114925

      1133 is the Reversal of 2173, which is Twelve Ages: 48:                         Take your 
guidance from subsidence                       The Receptive holds the key            To the 
pattern of the matter and colliding energy.            Let it ride around the angles and the green 
perimeter            and the answers are the angels                       and the bold delimit her. 
                             Now we compare the Transitions of the three corners, and the 
Surrounding Six, with the center of 292. First are the corners of 139 – 105 – 363 transitioning 
through 292.

          661                                             437

           105                                                                 The total of these 
three transitions is 607. This is a very special Ditrune, being the hinge upon which the          
King         Wen sequence rests. Its ternary is 122222, which becomes 31 in base 10 as a binary 
number (and 133 in base 4). 607 is also AMTh, truth, in full. This word has a simple value of 441, 
which is a very potent acronym in our Mysteries, as detailed by Frater O.L. in Epistle 25. This 
word can be represented as “Amun Miqdash Tolumah”, “Amun in the Sanctuary of Mystery”. In 
this we have all 3 words forming a Transitional Triad of 97 -&gt; 444 =551.                       
607 is also the 111         th         Prime, which is Aleph, the Ox. This is the Ox that pulls the 
Plough, guided by the Farmer. The Ox corresponds to the Horse in terms of Merkabah. It is the Horse 
that pulls the Chariot, yet the difference is that one is done for peace and the latter is done for 
war. The Ox pulls the Plough, creating the fertile soil in which to plant the seed.                 
     Moving to the next layer of interpretation, we have 292 transitioned through the Six 
Surrounding. We can then form the following chart of Transitions:

  A lot could be written on this number 934; firstly, it is Liber          A’ash verse         6: 
                         “Only in the end shalt thou give up thy sap when the great God F.I.A.T. 
is enthroned on the day of Be-With-Us.”                    In TQ, “F.I.A.T.” equals 26, which 
is the Lunar Triune. “Be-With-Us” equals 93. When we transition 26 -&gt; 93 = 163, which is the 
Reversal of 747, AMUN.  “The day of Be-With-Us” is a most curious term, having its origin is 
the Theosophical schools. It refers to         the state         of para-nirvana.                   
  934 is also the sum of the Seven Signs and their planetary rulers. This is 225 for the Zodiac 
signs and 709 for the 7 Planets. Making a Triad of these: 225 -&gt; 709 = 482, which is the Greek 
word “Rhombus”, which carries many meanings. Its ultimate origin has the meaning “to spin, to 
whirl”. An apt description of the rotation of the Planets within the Zodiac. The sum of this 
Triad is 1416 which differs from its Conrune 1860 by 444. 444 is the Perimeter formed by the 
Pillars.                     We find 607 to be the Transitional Sum of 292 to the 3 points, and 934 
to be the Transitional Sum of 292 to the Surrounding Six. Their simple sum of the Transitions is 
1541, which is 23×67. 23+67 is 90, thus Tzaddi, being “The Star”. But as always, the secret is 
revealed in the Reversal, 1469:                          “Coordinate that with your star in 
blackness and your white goat and your green crocodile and your red dragon and your blue sphinx and 
all will be well.”                                                  The Pillars                   
 The Pillars of the Adyton are located          coterminous to the Throne.          The arrangement 
         is based on the geometry of the Vault of Hestia,          (         see Bulletin 63        
 )         . This is based on 137 being the Incircle di         ameter of an isosceles triangle.  
This forms a very intimate relationship with the Pyramidion in the form of the following 
Transitional Equation:                       4179 → 137 = 5524 = 3031 → 1294                    
    5524 is              Αστρον Αργον, Astron Argon, Silver Star, in Full. This is 4 × 
1381, which is from Seven Spirits:                                 left    top                      
                                  But the summit is hidden in the clouds like Olympus and above 
them will be seen the Vision of Vitality when the Ruse of Reality is transcended             .      
              This also represents the Transition of Crown Chakra Κορυφή through Omega, the 
letter attributed to the center. (1098 → 800). 5524 is the Conrune of 4235, which is the word 
προφήτις in full, meaning prophetess. Thus, we have the Prophetess/Priestess of the Silver 
Star, the          Title of the Priestess Card. Further, Αστρον Αργον equals 945, and 
προφήτις = 1268. The Triad of 945 → 1268 = 1066, the Lesser Light! This is the Moon, the 
planet of the Priestess card.          Note          that the Difference between these 2 values is 
323, which is προμήθεια         ,          the          Name          of          She      
    wh         ose          vision          revealed          the Vault of Hestia.                  
   Here we find the differential of 1289, thus 9 × 1289 is the sum of the 7 Transitions created by 
the Blessing words in Greek. 1289 is also Ηφαιστος, Hephaistos, the God of the Forge, whose 
Roman equivalent is Vulcan. Here we find the conjoining of          two                   distinct  
        gods that          share                   the          commonality              left    
bottom                                                   of Fire. They both use it in different 
ways. Hestia is all about the hearth and nourishing with fire.          Hephaestus is all about the 
forge, using fire to create. The         s         e are intimately related to the Pyramidion       
  :          Hestia + Hephaestus (516 + 1289) = 1805. 3 × 1805 = 5415, the Conrune of 4179. They 
differ by 773, and herein indicates the presence of the Sphinx.                             We must 
pause and examine all this considering the orientation of the Throne and its relationship to the 
Pillars and the Walls. 323 is the corner of the Pyramidion that is facing the center of the Central 
Wall of the Adyton. But just as the Pyramidion is hidden, so must we also look at the hidden 
differential of this Conrune Pair, which is 143.          These          sum 466, the name of the 4 
Totems in English, as shown above.                                       We align 
προμήθεια to be Central. This leaves the other 2 corners, 372 &amp; 453, which sum 825, 
the value of Adyton. We then make a Triad of 323 → 825 = 1240, the Reversal of 1268!              
              It must be remembered that this is          the          Hidden         ;          
the Pyramidion is hidden within the Adept as well as the Differential of 143. Now we will look at 
what is revealed by this Mystical Orientation of the Throne.                     Here we see the 
upper face of the Throne, with 722 oriented towards these 2 same central squares. We simply sum 
these 3           numbers: 722 + 470 + 613 = 1805, which we just saw as Hestia + Hephaestus.        
             Then we add the hidden and revealed, and attain 2271, the reversal of 757, MAION. And 
since the Center of the Throne is 292, we sum 2271 + 292 = 2563, the value of Liber Arma minus the 
Greek Vowels.                     One last aspect to examine in this orientation is the fact that 
722 is the alignment of the face of the Throne, then 466 is at the base of the throne. 466 + 722 = 
1188, which is also the sum of the Differentials of the          seven planetary          
Exaltation degrees of the Zodiac.                     466 has played a prominent role in the 
development of the Adyton.          Th         is          is Nuit, and she represents the Starry 
Canopy of the Heavens tha         t are          uph         e         ld by the          Four      
    Pillars of the Chariot Atu, herein represented by the Four Pillars of the Adyton.          The  
        q         uestion becomes, how do we represent the          Four Pillars         ?          
          For this we shall refer to a          canonical          basis in Liber M         A       
            3:38, which in part, reads:                      The light divine, the cosmic ray       
               Is pouring through the open door                      Within the House of Tum I made 
                     For Ra, Khephri, and wise Hathor                      I am thy Theban, O 
Khonsu                      The seer Show-the-Light-to-You                                The Four 
Pillars of the Adyton shall then be named after          Gods of this          canticle.          
We can then make the following          attributes of the Pillars:                         Atun – 
                 North-West                           741                         Ra –            
              North-East                  101                         Kephra –                  
South-East                  790                         Hathor –                  South-West      
                     910                    We can then form the following Fourfold Transitional    
      Square                   f         rom these          four numbers:                           
                                                                            We then sum 2542 for    
      the name of the Four Gods of the Pillars, Thelema, spelled in full!                   The sum 
of the Transitions is          4954, of which not much can be said. The          “kitchen sink’ 
sum of the whole figure is          97 × 102, being A         MVN × AMVNH, the word of the Lauds  
       .          Its Reversal is 3118, which is the Greek word          Καμαρα         ,     
     Kamara         , in full, meaning          a          c         hamber, a          v         
ault, hence our English word Camera         .                     Here the idea          of a 
camera is that it          cap         tures both time and event. We read in the Book of 
Dissolution         ,          3         6          –                        36. This captured 
both time and place, to commemorate both.                         The event and the position.       
                  Both must be honored with a sanctuary                    A fuller commentary on 
this arrangement will be found          Bulletin 65, On          Liber Iota.                        
  0    2375444                                                                    This is a graphic 
of the Chariot Atu from the Thoth Tarot.          This imagery is important in the          
development of the ideas          of the Adyton. Herein we see the          Four Pillars upholding 
the canopy of Heaven         , surrounding the Charioteer.          Across it is          written   
       the word ABRAHADABRA, but within the context of the Aeon of MA, this          word          
has          become          ANKAQOQA         KN         A         .                      Unlike 
Abrahadabra, ANKAQOQ         AKNA is          a          palindromic          word         , with 
no doubt          about          its spelling.          It          has the value of 414, which was 
first          mentioned in          MA          1:77.          Because it is a palindrome, we can 
understand that          the middle letter, “         O         ”         , as a pivot point    
     .          We have          O which is 70, the EYE, and 344                   which is the 
Hebrew word            שלחו           which means to send          ,           or           a 
dispatching of           a message.           Our next step is to make a Triad of 70 → 344 = 678, 
          and we discover the TQ of            “             And through this Eye the entire 
cosmos is discovered in its Empty Net           .           ”                               In    
       the Adyton           these 10 letters symbolize           the           10 spheres of the    
       Pyramidion.           They are           split into           pairs of           5 and 5     
     , a          s follows:                        319 + 366 + 350 + 452 + 685          = 2172, 
the binary sum of the Tarot          of Amun                        323 + 389 + 453 + 470 + 372 = 
2007,          the          circumference          of          a circle whose radius is 319.        
            We then make a Triad, 2172          → 2007 = 2094.          This is the          
result          of adding the 2          factors of the          Transgram between the          two 
halves of the Holy Book         s         ,          457808 = 248 × 1846,          where           
        248 + 1846 = 2094.                     248 =             the adyton of the seven            
       184         6          =             It has walls of seven, one foot thick, and the vault of 
heaven made of fire glazed brick It is strong and sturdy and withstands direct assault It is home 
to weary wanderers inside its very vault.                    We          then have 344,          (  
       the 10 letters         )          and the value of the Pyramidion,          (         4179   
      )         . 344 →          4179 = 5344.          This is a major nexus point.          
Looking at                   5344, the sum of its factors is          10584, which is 4 × 2646, 
the result of the multiplication of the          part         s          of a 7-sided Prism         
, which we sa         w          above.          It is also 7 × 1512, the number of unique         
 English words in Liber M         A         .                      It should be noted that 5344 is 
the sum of Liber Carrus, 1487, and Liber Arma,          3857         .          The Differential    
      of 5344 &gt;          3767 is 1577, the AIN SOPH!          This is the ultimate root of the 
Tree of Life         .          And          here we must end where we started.          The Triad 
of 5524 → 5344 = 5785         , the Greek word          Mysterion in full                   –   
                           Μυστηριον                    5785          is the          
Reversal of 3803,                   όμικρον, omicron, in full         , which is the letter 
of the Eye.                     Omikrον                     Taking the words Mysterion and 
Omikron in their normal values and making a Triad reveals the perimeter of the Adyton: 1178 &gt; 
360 = 1741, the antigram of 1295.                                The Walls of the Adyton            
        Within the Adyton stand the Seven Walls, as Guardians and Watchtowers of our Mysteries. As 
I stated in my first treatise on the Adyton, the Walls represent the field in which the work of the 
Magician is accomplished. To review:                    The Walls of the Adyton were designed to 
encapsulate the Venusian/Earth cyclic relationship. The Chamber of the Adept was designed to hold 
40 Squares per Wall, the whole chamber then containing 280 squares. 280 is the value of ‘IOS’, 
the Arrow. 40 as 5x8 can be seen as the Venus/Earth Synodic relationship of 8 Venus synodic 
revolutions equal         ing          5 Earth years. In terms of triunes, Venus is 17, Sol is 13, 
summing 40. One could stop there and even reinterpret the Chamber of the Adepts with the AMUN Tree 
and other revelations that have been given to us. Bu         t as Liber MA ex         h         
orts…But proceed! proceed!                    13 Venusian sidereal years          are          
equivalent to 8 Terran years. We have elevated this from the geocentric 5/8 synchronicity of 
Earth/Venus to the heliocentric 8/13 synchronicity. On the wall, we can say that the rows are the 
Venus aspect of the 104 Array a         nd the columns the Terran aspect of the 104 Array. The 
Walls of the Adyton are then structured according to the heptagonal arrangement of the Ditrunes. 
There are 728 Ditrunes, which is 104 when divided by 7. 104 is 8x13, so each wall is an array of 
104 cells that          have 8          rows          and 13          column         s. T         
hus, we attribute each of the 728 Ditrunes to a cell, according to their Zodiacal association on 
the Heptagons.                    To be more technical, 8 and 13 are sequential Fibonacci numbers. 
Each wall then has a perimeter of 42. The total perimeter of all walls then being 7 x 42, equaling 
294, the TQ of both these phrases:                         “the line in seven segments” &amp; 
“the watch-towers of the Universe”.                     104 is most famously the value of 
Tzaddi          in full         , and thus related to the Star card. The Converse of 104 is 624, 
and when 624 is multiplied by the Key Number, 133, we attain the sum of the Dance of Days calendar, 
82,992. When we apply all this to the idea of Time, 104 years brings together 3 cycles that we will 
be addressi         ng:          the Thelemic Year of 365 days, the Dance of Days of 260 days, and 
the Venusian sidereal cycle of 584 days. Thus, 104 years equals 37960 days, which gives is 104 
Thelemic years, 146 Dance of Days cycles, and 65 Venus cycles. Note that the Thelemic and Dance of 
Days calendar will align every 52 years, and this period is usually referred to as a Calendar 
Round, yet it takes 2 Calendar Rounds to unite it to the Venusian 584-day cycle.

review          the V         enusian cycle and its different elements. The 584-day cycle starts at 
its Inferior Conjunctio         n,          when it is between          Earth          and Sol      
   , (         also the middle of its retrograde motion         )         . The chart below 
diagrams this motion. The red indicates her retrograde motion, while the black is her direct 
motion. The yellow dot represents points of maximum brightness. It should be noted that Venus is 
hidden at either one of its conjunction points. At its Inferior Conjunction because it is in front 
of the sun, and her Superior Conjunction behind the sun. These are represented by points 1 and 6 in 
the second diagram.                                                                      3444875

                                Hopefully          these diagrams help to further your 
understanding of what the 584-day Venus cycle looks like from different perspectives. There are 
various measurements for the time that Venus spends in these different phases of her orbit. The 
most accepted are that she spends 526 days as Morning/Evening Star, and 58 days hidden. 526 is also 
the aliquot sum of 584, with its deficiency of 58.  I find it remarkable that the numerical 
properties of this number encode the Venusian cycle. When we transition 584 -&gt; 58, we attain 
450, the numerical value of NU, in Greek.                                It should first be noted, 
and quite profoundly, that the Venus point of Liber Carrus, DIO, equals 584 when spelled in full. 
The letters themselves equal 84, “I am Nuit” in TQ. The Rerune of 584 is 680, which is Zygos in 
Greek,          the name of          Libra. Just as important is the fact, as noted by Frater O.L. 
in Epistle 46,          that          584 is the diameter of a circle whose area is the Global Sum 
of Liber L. Halving this gives us the radius, which is 292, “Linea virdis gyrat universa”.      
              The difference between the occulte         d 58 days          of Venus          and   
       her          526 “Star” d         ays is 468, the converse of 260. This is also DEMETER 
in Greek. In this we have a direct correspondence to the Dance of Days calendar. When Frater O.L. 
and I reinterpreted the Aztec Tzolkin in light of Trigrammic QBLH, it was hoped that it would shed 
further light on the prophetic nature of our System. It has indeed done that. Time is cyclic in 
nature, not linear.                             This occulted period of 58 days is divided into 50 
days behind the sun and 8 days in front of the sun. 8 -&gt; 50 = 65, the number of 584-day cycles 
of Venus in 104 years, or 2 Calendar Rounds. This is 37960 days, which is the Decagram 1221001221, 
a ternary palindrome. 1221 is 52 in decimal, thus you have 52 over 52 with 2 Tao-lines between 
them. Another way to view this is the Hebrew letters Cheth and Nun. This forms the word ChN, which 
means grace or charm, attributes of Venus. This is also considered a notariqon for Chokmah 
Nesethrath, the Secret Wisdom. It should be well noted that these 2 letters in full equal 418 + 
756, which is 1174, having 931, AMMON, as a differential.                     We see here that 
there is a strong Venusian influence within the structure of the Planetary Watchtowers. She is in 
either Her Morning Star or Evening Star cycle for 263 days, and that is the 56          th          
Prime, which is NV, the word of NV as six and fifty.                     We learn in Liber L that 
the Five-Pointed Star is Nuit’s. I propose that this five-pointed Star is actually the pentagram 
created by Venus’s synodic cycle. In fact, in Gre         ek, the          term for          fi   
      ve-pointed star is “Το Πεντάκτινο Αστέρι”, equaling 1872, whose 
reversal is 104. Structurally, 1872 is the septagram 2120100, thus hiding 120100, or 414, under the 
7          th          Yin Line.                     As stated above, the Watchtowers are composed 
of the 728 ditrunes arranged as pairs in the sevenfold regime. This creates 52 sets composed of 7 
Ditrune pairs a piece. We refer to these as Zodiacal Heptagons, as each Ditrune Pair has a unique 
differential that is attributed to a degree on the Zodiac. The 4 Prime Ditrune pairs are not 
attributed to a degree but are the Equinoctial/Solstice points. The remaining 360 Conrune pairs are 
then attributed to the degrees of the Zodiac. One will note that 7 does not divide the circle into 
whole parts. T         his division of the Zodiac can only occur because of the Prime Ditrunes.     
                Much thought has been given to the structure of the walls. How to structure them in 
a perfectly balanced way, and it was not until          the          Trinity          Operation     
     that this was realized, and the alchemical formula of their structure was fully          
manifested         . The key is the 4 Heptagon Sets that contain the Prime Ditrunes. And as it 
turns out, the Ditrunes tell us how they want to be structured in this matter.          Below is 
the basic diagram of how the Ditrunes are attributed to the Walls. The numbers represent which 
Heptagon set the number is pulled from, with the lighter colors representing the Day Ditrune of the 
Conrune Pair, while the darker colors are the Night Ditrune of the set.          It will be noticed 
the          39          th          Heptagon set is placed in the middle. This is done on purpose, 
as          the          control number of this Heptagon is 195         , and this is the TQ value 
of Argentum Aurora, the sacred name of our O         rder.

middle column a total of 20748, which is 133 × 156, the 7 Planets as 133 and the 12 Zodiacal signs 
as 156. This means that what remains is 244608, which is 182 × 1344! 182 is the number given in 
Seven Spirits, while 1344 is the MIX Founding Heptagon whose founding was perpetuated by that 
document.                     The planetary order of the walls shall be Saturn, Sol, Mercury, Luna, 
Venus, Juppiter, Mars. Luna shall be the Central Wall, with the whose central squares will be 470 
&gt; 613, the 143 Differential. This makes the Central column of all 7 walls 3534, which is Liber 
Graduum, Initium: 49 –                           Thus is the cosmos revolving eternal. Thus is 
the center absorbing the Light. The Disk has been graven with images splendid, and each is a signal 
from one of the angels. Age after age is engraved on the edges, etched by the swords of the words 
of the aeons, spun by the fingers that clutched the sword hilt. And One is the finger that traced 
out the circle, One is the index that charted the course.                    The Central Wall then 
has a total of 43068, 97 × 444, Amun × MQDSh, Sanctuary of Amun. Removing the Central Wall and 
summing the other 6 gives us 222288, 176 × 1263, 1263 being Gnosis. One last aspect to consider is 
the Central 2 rows, which I call the Belt of AMUN. This sums 67977, which is 91 × 747, the number 
of columns or AMN multiplied by the god of the Aeon, AMVN. The remaining 6 rows would then sum 
197379, 117 × 1687                         117 =             the castle keep                       
  1687 =             Your Will is but a trajectory It is not a host of conditions It is not a nest 
of contradictions It is not choices based on reason. It is the orbit that can wind its way through 
the Labyrinth to the center.                    We can then make the following chart to track these 
numbers:                                                                   Sum of Category          
               Sum of Remaining                              Seven Columns                         
20748                         244608                              Central Wall                      
   43068                         222288                              Belt of Amun                   
      67977                         197379                                   These figures should 
be considered individually, separate from each other. There is one other thing we could consider, 
and that is separating the Belt of Amun and the Seven Columns, as the         ir          
convergence is the central 2 squares of each wall, and this is the Å Founding Heptagon. Because 
this arrangement is composed of 224 cells, it will be called the          Αιγισ          (224) 
         of the Watchtowers, or the Aegis of the Watchtowers.                    The sum of these 
224 cells is 83304, while the remaining 504 cells are 182052.                        83304 = 104 × 
801.                         104 is the number of cells per wall. 104 is also the TQ of           
Cauldron         .                        801 is the TQ of “          the skein of the golden 
coppery leaden silvery mercurial tinny and ferric veins         ”                        We can 
then say that the Cauldron, which is central to the Vault of Hestia represent         ing          
the square formed by the Pillars is the Mixing          vessel          of the          7          
metals. The Triad of 104 → 801 = 1672          =          4 × 418, the Charioteer          with  
       in the 4 Pillars.                        182052 = 78 × 2334.                         78 is 
the Mystic Number of 12, and therefore can be seen as the Zodiac, and the light therefrom.          
               2334 is the Reversal of 1162, the Word of the Aeon. It is also the TQ of Liber 
Graduum Finem: 56 –                          Each of these sphinxes is guarding the temple the 
pharaoh has built from the dust of the Earth. For Nature provided the Stone for the building, the 
Light of the stars to be seen from within. Here he will marry his soul to the cosmos, here he will 
journey into the great void.                        The Sphinxes of this verse are the four powers 
of the Adept mentioned in the previous verse          (55)         . We could then say that each 
Watchtower has its own Aegis which divides it into Four Quarters, each Quarter guarded by a Sphinx. 
                    To          examine this further, we can          divid         e Aegis number, 
83304 into 2 parts, the Seven Pillars and the          Belt of Amun,          with one rule – the 
Å          Heptagon will be counted as part of the Seven Pillars, and not included in the Belt of 
Amun.          The          14 Ditrunes that compose this convergence point          is 5421, the 
Reversal of 1391:                                      “            That throne is the axle all 
the heavens and earth and planets and stars revolve around. As it is said ‘yon galaxy is but the 
smoke ring of mine incense            ”                    This          gives us 20748 for the 
Seven Pillars and 62556 for what remains of the Belt of Amun.          62556 =  12 × 5213.         
 This is the Greek phrase “         το                   άρρητον         ” in fu       
  ll.          Th         is          Greek phrase translates to “the ineffable”         .      
    It refers to something that is inexpressible or unspeakable, often due to its sacred or immense 
nature         .          The Triad of          20748 → 62556          =          162648

Wall. Technically, they are attributed to the Central Column of each Wall.                          
   The order of the Planets is ordered to give the Lovely Star when the Liber M         A          
order of the Metals is used to create the Lovely Star. As stated above, the sum of the Metals in 
Liber M         A          is 440, and this is the Reversal of 5976, the Seven Chakras         ;    
      it is          also          the Differential of 185, the edge length of the perimeter of the 
Adyton. A detailed account of this arrangement can be found in Bulletin 33. An in-depth study of 
this Bulletin is suggested.                     In respect to the Adyton, we can take the sum of 
the Seven Pillars, 20748, and the sum of the 4 Levels from Bulletin 33, 4369, thus integrating the 
4 and the 7, and attain 25137, which is the Reversal of 1099! This is          –                  
                אמעון                   Spelled in full.                                       
 The Cubical Altar                    The Cubical Altar shall be based on the idea of the 
hypercube. The Altar itself symbolizes the visible universe and was placed at the center of the 
Hall of the Neophyte. Within the Adyton, the Charioteer is the focus, and the altar is displaced 
from the center. It then becomes symbolic of the multi-dimensional universe, and all that it 
implies.                     The placement of the Altar is based on the proportions of the Polygon 
Ring. Their difference is 19, whose Key in the Tarot of Amun is the Dissolution Card. In short, any 
polygon ring can create a “hidden polygon” by taking the measurement at the vertices, its 
‘thickness’, multiplying it by the number of vertices, and using this result as the 
circumcircle radius of a polygon with the same number of vertices. If one were to use the thickness 
of the edges instead, it gives you the incircle radius of the same polygonal result. Or one can 
simply multiply the differences between the 2 edge lengths by the number of vertices and get the 
edge length of the hidden polygon. In this case we have 7 × 19 = 133. This gives us a perimeter of 
931, AMMON. This gives us a Circumcircle Radius of 153.2669, and a Circumcircle Circumference of 
963.0041. 963 is AChD in Full (111 + 418 + 434). It is also the Hebrew phrase            עטרת 
עטרה          , meaning “the crown of the crown”. This can be esoterically interpreted as 
the most refined tier of the Crown Chakra, the Sahasrara Chakra. Achad has the meaning of 1, 
representing the Unity of the Crown Chakra. We then make a Triad of 1 → 963 = 1577, the Ain Soph! 
We can then understand that Hidden 133 Heptagon is the unifying principal that becomes the first 
gateway of manifestation, or Tao becoming yang.                       Following this further, we 
create a hidden polygon ring between the Inner 166 Heptagon and the Hidden 133 Heptagon. This has a 
difference of 33. 7 × 33 = 231, the Mystic Number of 21, whose Tarot Key is the Water Atu. This 
gives us a heptagon whose perimeter is 1617, which is the Greek word ΣΧΙΞΩ, meaning “to rend 
(the veil)”. It is as if the Adyton is in a perpetual Sign of the Enterer. The Reversal of 1617 
is 713, the TQ of “that the Seven might move indeed, yet ever point to the unchanging One”. It 
must be noted that this Heptagon exists outside the boundaries of the Adyton wall of 1295.  This is 
the One of ACHAD in full, found as the circumference of the 133 Heptagon. The Seven are the 7 
planetary Trigrams that total 133. We can also note that the Triad of One (47) → Seven (87) = 
229, “it flows from all directions”. This saying pertains to the Word of the Aeon, Katalysis, 
as described in verse 0 &amp; 1 of the Book of Dissolution.                       We have then 
formed 4 Heptagons based on the geometry of the Adyton, two that are revealed, and two that are 
concealed. We then make a Triad of the Revealed and the Concealed – 2578 → 2457 = 2639, 7 × 
377, 377 being the Hebrew word ShBVO, which is 7.                     The traditional altar of the 
Adept has been a double cube. It was stated by Crowley that “the Altar must embody the 
Magician’s knowledge of the laws of Nature, which are the laws through which he works.” And 
further, “He should endeavor to make geometrical constructions to symbolize cosmic 
measurements”. The Altar as the tesseract does exactly that.  Of the doubled cube, we read in 
Liber MA –                          Then this doubled cube in its failure holds a key in it       
              The double cube, as the Altar, fails as the true nature of the Altar which, within 
the context of the Aeon of Ma, is a hypercube – not a cube on top of another cube. It shows a way 
in which to connect with the higher dimensions through its symbolism. We are no longer bound to the 
idea of directionality.                    The Cubical Altar is based on a Hypercube, or Tesseract. 
There are 80 parts to a tesseract:                   8 Cells + 24 Faces + 32 Edges + 16 Vertices    
               There is also a center, which has “no points nor parts nor magnitude”, and this 
can be considered the 81st part of the tesseract. These 81 parts can be aligned exactly with the 81 
possible tetragrams of the ternary system. 3 types of line on 4 levels equals 3          4          
= 81. There is not only an exact match with the number of parts (81), but the type         s        
  of tetragram         s         , based on how many zero digits are involved, has exactly the same 
subset numbers:                  81 Tetragrams: 1 has 4 zeroes; 8 have 3 zeroes; 24 have 2 zeroes; 
32 have 1 zero; 16 have no 0.                    Each part of the tesseract is in a different 
dimension. The Cells are 3 D cubes; the Faces are 2 D squares; the Edges are 1 D lines, and the 
Vertices are 0 D points, (this means that only the ‘center’ is 4D, and this is reserved for the 
tetragram that is all Zeroes). So, in one sense, the 4 D hypercube is composed of 8 intertwined 3 D 
cubes, or Cells, which form the surface volume of the tesseract. Only 1 of these 8 Cells will be 
considered as the Cubical Altar of the Adyton.                    Having these various parts in 
mind, the 8 Cells can be considered as individual cubes, which can be visualized by the following 
diagram:                                                                                           
This is but one of many depictions of a hypercube. It represents the projection of the 8 corners of 
a regular cube into 4D space. It should be remembered that this is a projection only. The Tesseract 
contains 8 cubes. It should be kept in mind that each cube has its own function and importance. For 
the purposes of the Adyton, the cell of the Hypercube that will represent the Altar will be the 
Outer Cube.                    In its simplest terms, the tesseract is constructed by first 
assigning tetragrams to the 16 Vertices. Then Transitional Triads are made between adjacent 
Vertices, to get the tetragram of the Edge that connects them. Finally, Vertices that are 
diagonally opposite each other on all the square Faces are           transitioned through each 
other to get the value of the tetragram for each Face. Finally, each opposite Face is transitioned 
to get the tetragram for that particular Cell. In this way, all 80 parts of the tesseract are 
perfectly aligned with all 80 possible tetragrams, with no duplicates, and no missing numbers.

Adyton, while the other 7 will remain in their multi-dimensional state. This means that we must 
examine what this means. The 8 Cubes are as follows:

             Seeking the necessity of precision, diligence shows that the best option is the 10 of 
Wands, whose tetragram is 54. It should be noted that the card title, Oppression, is misleading and 
is a little outdated. Its divinatory meaning shows us the          weight          of life’s 
struggles and the burden they          bring         , yet it is al         so their          
completion after a long journey. Applied to the Altar, it lends the meaning of the responsibility 
of the Adept and the due diligence they must attain to complete the Great Work. It is a 10, 
therefore it represents completion. It is fire; therefore, it represents purification.              
       In Liber LUXORAT, the 10 of Wands is verse A:10, the Solar chapter –                       
  At the peak of the Arrow, the smooth point gleams – the pyramidion enlightening the world.      
              The Altar is then representative of the smooth point, within which the other 7 Cubes 
of the Altar are concealed. The sum          of the          nu         clear hexagram         s 
for the Cubes are 606, which          in turn          is the nuclear hexagram of the Devil Atu. It 
should be noted that on traditional Tarot cards, he is shown as sitting on a double cube. We then 
form a Triad of 486 → 606 = 726, which is the nuclear hexagram of the Empress Atu. This is the 
“Seventy to her Four”                    Symbolically, the Adept sitting on the Throne 
represents the pyramidion of the tetrahedral Throne, which represents the element of          F     
    ire as shown above. The pyramidion is represented by the number 4179 as shown above. We then 
make a Triad of 486 → 4179 = 5658, the reversal of 1886. 1886 is the Greek word          
Eucaristos         , Eucharistos. Yet the Key is examining 5658 as a differential. This gives us 
the following Quadset:                                                                 14268        
                               8610                                             3116                
                       5986                                         We find that its reverse 
Differential is 2870! 2870 is the surface area of a hypercube whose surface volume is the Global 
Sum of the Holy Books of MIX. 2870 is 10 × 287, which we have noted is “the Cubical Altar of the 
Universe”. That traditional cubical altar is considered to have 10 sides. 5658 is also 41 × 138. 
138 is the number of Cards in the esoteric Decanal Tarot of the MIX, being the 97 cards of the 
Tarot of Amun + 36 cards to represent the Decans as groups of 10 days + the 5 epagomenal days. This 
means that 41 cards were added to the 97 cards giving us 138 cards. 5658 then equals the number of 
cards added, 41, multiplied by the grand total of cards it produces (138) by adding them to the 
Tarot of Amun.                      5658 gives us the relationship between the adept as the 
Pyramidion and the Cubical Altar, whose key to understanding is the Decanal Tarot. This 
relationship is contained within a heptagon whose perimeter is 1295. We then make a Triad of 1295 
→ 5658 = 3463, the 485          th          Prime (485 = 5 × 97). This is the Reversal of 3829, 
which is the sum of the letters, in          f         ull         ,          of Liber Carrus, 7 × 
547          =          Panta Rei.                     When we exile this cube, we can also look at 
          what          remains in terms of the sum of the nuclear hexagrams. This idea can only be 
applied to Cubes, as all the “numbers” are used more          than          once. Faces are 
shared between 2 Cubes, Edges are shared between 3 Faces, and Vertices are shared between 4 Edges. 
The only occurrence that is unique is the Cube numbers. The sum of the nuclear hexagrams is 29484. 
The nuclear value of the 10 of Wands is 486. 29484 – 486 = 28998. This number is 81 × 358. 358 
is the sum of the Differentials of 27 Sag, the present Galactic Center          (270)         , 
towards which the Adyton is oriented, and its “south pole” at 27          Gemini (88)         . 
 It should be noted that the Trios of these 2 degrees sum 1450, the Reversal of 970.                
            M         ore importantly, this number 28998 is the Reversal of 418, the Chariot! Thus, 
confirming the purpose of the Adyton, as a commemoration of the Adept as          the          
Charioteer. We take this one step further, as one could argue that 29484 does not count all the 
individual          occurrences          of a Nuclear Hexagram.

Nuclear Hexagrams when counted in this way equals 88452, the reversal of 364. We then remove 486, 
giving us 87966. This number is the Reversal of 526, which is the TQ of             “I was the 
priest of Ammon-Ra in the temple of Ammon-Ra at Thebai         .” This is the Adept as “the 
priest of Ammon-Ra” in the Adyton, which is “the temple of Ammon-Ra” at Thebai. Thebai is 
Thebes, and it is the Theban Triad whose gods are invoked through the formulation of Liber M        
 A         . Transliterated to Hebrew, as ThHBAI, this word equals 418. We can also make a Triad of 
486 → 88452 = 175446. This number is the Reversal of 566, Tikkun.                     We can take 
all this symbolism of the Altar and say that the Altar is the instrument by which the Adept, as the 
Charioteer, implements Tikkun, or restoration. The Altar is placed at 153, the rounded radius of 
the Hidden 133 Heptagon. Since the Altar is represented by 486 and centered at this point, we make 
a Triad of 153 → 486 = 441, AMTh, Truth.                     Having established the Altar, we 
shall now examine its particulars. From the charts above, the Cubical Altar of the Adyton is 
constructed using the cards assigned to the tetragrams of the Outer Cube of the Tesseract.

Emperor                                  The Vertices are all Major Arcana. The sum of the letters 
attributed to these is 243, which is the Greek word κορβαν, meaning an offering made to a 
deity, which           is          placed on an Altar. The Tetragrams that compose the vertices sum 
588. This is a number rich in symbolism. A whole document could be written about its virtues. In 
respect to these mysteries, it is the M Trigram over the M Trigram:

                               These edges total 804, which is the Greek word αγω, which is a 
geometric term of drawing a line. It is cognate with the Latin term, ago, meaning “I Act”. The 
Reversal of 804 is 460, which is:                          I AM the force behind NU &amp; NU is the 
breath of what I AM                                   The Faces

         Strength                                 The value of the Tetragrams that form the Faces 
of this cube sum 363, “the set of facets of a jewel in many planes”.                     We are 
then able to make a simple sum of the parts of the Altar:                        Vertices = 588     
                   Edges = 804                        Faces = 363                        Cube = 54  
                   The total of 1809 is the Reversal of 41, MA. 41 is also the number of Major Atus 
in the Indestructible Tarot of Amun. 1809 is also 9 × 201, and this is MA in full, or “          
Understand MA         ”. This Reversal set is then “understood” as MA in Her simple addition, 
and as MA in full. 1809 is also BITh QDSh spelled in Full, meaning Holy House.                    
Upon the top of the altar shall be a 4 × 4 checkered design, alternating blue and green colors.  
We read in the Book of Dissolution: 42 –                      “Both red ink and black are 
equal. Now the writing may be done in blue and green.”                    In terms of accounting, 
red ink represents debt and black ink represents profit. Blue is then the color of what we are 
responsible for, and green is the color of growth. The red ink becomes blue, while the black ink 
becomes green.                    The structure of the Tarot of Amun is such that 81 of the cards 
represent the 81 Tetragrams of base 3. This then leaves 16 Cards not represented by the 81 lines of 
Liber Trigrammaton. Yet the question remains, what to do with these additional 16 cards. The answer 
is hinted          at          in the structure of the 97 Ditrune itself. It is 81 over the 16 
Ditrune. This has been gone over extensively by the Seer in both his private and public writings. 
These 16 cards then become the 16 Tetragrams of Binary and become the gear by which the Tetragrams 
of Ternary are created. We can then confirm that these 16 Binary Tetragrams are represented on the 
Altar in a 4 × 4 Magic Square as follows:                                                        G 
                                      T                                       N

  12269                                      120                                  The total decimal 
value of the binary values is 120, which is the TQ of “           chessboard         ”, which 
is          the          Σ 0-15. Adding 120 to the rest of the deck, 36249, equals 36369. This is 
81 × 449, which in TQ is “           Keep the structure intact, but open the doors.         ”. 
81 here can indicate the 81 tetragrams in ternary, which is the ‘structure’, yet ‘the 
doors’ (97) are opened by the addition of the 16 binary tetragrams. We have 81: the number of 
Ternary Tetragrams, and 16: the number of Binary tetragrams. Forming a Triad 16 -&gt; 81 = 185, the 
Conrune of 97, “           the doors         ”.                       There is a much deeper 
mystery surrounding all of this, since a tesseract can be made from the Global Sum of the Holy 
Books of Mix. The value of a single face of the Holy Books of MIX tesseract is 2870 = 10 × 287, 
287 =           “            the Cubical Altar of the Universe          ”         . When we 
apply the sum of these Binary Tetragrams to the value of a face, we form the following Triad, 120 
-&gt; 2870 = 4663. This is the 631          st          Prime, and in TQ, we have the following – 
          “             My words are truth; they celebrate Your power, O Khonsu the Great         
  ”.                       Turning to what is concealed, we look at the Reversal of this number 
4663 and discover it to be 2765, which is Liber Graduum, Caput Medium: 71, a most fitting gematria 
indeed!                        “             Just as the ancient Egyptians have shown you the 
side and the front and the side once again. So too in this dream are the faces of the cube given to 
you at once. All is beheld in a singular vision a higher dimension revealing its view. This is the 
web of the wondrous spider, alive with the fire of the crackling wood           .”                
       Looking at the Quadset of this number, we find that the Differential Transgram is 1493, 
which is the sum of 440, the sum of the Atu Keys, plus 993, the TQ of the English of the Titles of 
these Keys, plus 120 equals 1493.                    We note that these are Atus 20 through 35, and 
this series of numbers sum 440, which is the Conrune of 625 (see above). In this, we refer to the 
names of the Elements and Zodiac in Greek. They sum 12269, which is the 1467          th          
Prime, 1467 is the value of the 4 corners of the Pyramidion of the Adept. We can then see that Amun 
is within these 16 aspects. Further, when we make a Triad out of the Binary value of these 16 
Tetragrams, 120, and the ternary value, 960: 120 → 960 = 1467. Thus, 1467 represents the 
transition of the 16 Tetragrams from one base to another base, from 2-base to 3-base, and then 1467 
as a Prime Ordinal gives us the total of these 16 Tetragrams in their Greek Equivalents.            
         Yet here is the fundamental synthesis of these ideas. Looking at the 12269 quadset, we 
find that it has a Septad number of 68880, the surface area                    the Hypercube of the 
Holy Books of Mix:                                                                                
We now look at which one of the Faces we shall use to represent the communion of the 16 Binary 
tetragrams and the 81 Ternary Tetragrams creating the Altar’s relationship to the Pyramidion. 
These faces are as follows:                                                        Card

  56                               488                                       Strength               
                55                               487                                      Totals    
                          363                              3279                                  
The sum of the Tetragrams is 363, so the question remains which of these faces is best to represent 
the Chessboard of the 16 Binary Tetragrams. After due diligence, it proves that the Lord of Love is 
the most favorable of options. The Binary of this card is 17, so we can represent the relationship 
of 17 → 120 = 226, “I who was a priest of Ammon-Ra” &amp; “NU is the breath of what I 
AM”.          A         lso          interesting is          the fact that 93, the number used to 
represent the previous Aeon, plus 133, the number used to represent the present Aeon, equals 226. 
The Conrune of 226 is 128, AL-AMVN.                     363 – 72 = 291. 291 = 3 × 97. This 
number represents the internal generator of the Adyton Tesseract. It will be shown later how 291    
      3          is concealed in the Grand Amalgamation of the Adyton. In TQ, 291 is “O hidden 
one, the Lord Amun!”. When we make a Triad of 72 → 291 = 510, from which we have the Hebrew 
word IShR, meaning to make          straight,          and just conduct. It is the idea of MA       
  ’         AT in Action, which is AMVNH.                      The Nuclear Hexagram for this is 
666, which is the first actual use of this number in our Gnosis. Its appearance here is both a 
remainder and a correction. It is a remainder of the Old Aeon and all its Apocalyptic alack. 
Mankind was destined to fail under this paradigm, that all was hopeless and bleak. The correction i 
        s then          at its core, 666 is the mystic number of 36, thus it has a solar nature. 
Its aliquot sum is 816. This is an essential nature of 666 as a number. 816 we saw as the 
Differential of 825 (Adyton in Greek) &gt; 1641 (the sum of the Gods of the 3 Chapters of Liber 
MA). 816 is also the Hebrew word            מתושע           which refers to an enneagram. 
Thus, we can examine 666 in the sense of an enneagram. When we make 666 the perimeter, we have an 
edge length of 74, which is Lamed. This corresponds to the Star of Lamed used on the Ceiling.       
                We can then calculate the Triplicity of Triples.  Each triangle would then have an 
edge length of 562.125, rounding to 562.           The value of           562 in TQ is Peacock:19 
–                         “I have come to destroy the old ways and to reveal a new gnosis”    
                    83185    4107180                                                    0    0      
       562 is also the Conrune of 287, “the Cubical altar of the Universe”. We then have an 
edge length of all 3 triangles equaling 1686. 1686 &gt; 861, AION, and has a differential of 825, 
ADYTON.                     This means that 666 is an Abundant number whose abundance is 150, and 
this is the Hebrew word “nest”.  We can this interpret this dynamic as “the Nest of the 
Enneagram”. The Circumference of the Nest would then be 679, 7 × 97. 679 is the TQ of the verse 
of Liber LUXORAT attributed to the 2 of Cups, O:2 –                            The Mother 
returns, feeding her offspring from the blood of her heart                       This nest is 
pictured on the Empress Atu. This is a reference to the Pelican’s Sacrifice myth, the mother 
being the Empress.  This is a symbol of self-sacrifice, whose ultimate expression is Agap          
é          . Armed with this information, we can now reinterpret 666 according to the geometry of 
the Enneagram. There is a lot implied here. It is 9 × 74. Adjustment is the 9           th         
  card of the Amun Tarot sequence. 666 is then a reference to the Adjustment card in terms of the 
Tarot of Amun, as 666 is the Hebrew letter value          , in full,           times its card’s 
positional value. 666 is no longer a number that represents the Apocalypse, or anything to do with 
it, in the context of the Aeon of MA. Under the New Gnosis, 666 is a number that represents, 
simply, Agape. This is the Title of the 2 of Cups in the Greek Tarot. We can then make the Triad 93 
→ 666 = 249 –                           The word of the law is Θελημα                     
                               The Grand Synthesis of Adyton                      Taking a step 
back, we have 3 Adornments that can be synthesiz          ed that exist within the 1162 Heptagon. 
We           first look at the Four Pillars and the Altar. These a          re 25          4        
  2 for the Pillars           and           1148 for the Altar, summing 3690.                       
To this is added the number of Aspects that compose the Netzach Tetrahedron           from which we 
formed the Throne          , 84, summing a total of           37          7          4, the 
Reversal of 1330, Amun in Kether.           Above we saw that 1330 is the Diameter of a circle 
whose           circumference is 4179, the 10 Aspects of the Pyramidion.           Adding           
these two Reversals           gives us 5104          , as 8 × 319.           We saw this number 
above as           Transitional Sum of this Pyramidion           as 4296 and its Reversal 808.      
                 This all happens within the 1162 Heptagon          , so we make a Triad of 1162 
→           3774 = 4904                            Katalusis                     In full          
                                                                 Epilogue                        In 
the traditional tarot, the Major Arcana contains a cast of characters in a highly symbolic tableau. 
In this procession, only two cards are objects: the Chariot and the Tower. In the former, a hidden 
figure sits and holds the Grail. In the latter, human figures are seen falling from the parapets as 
the Tower explodes. This card has been given more different names than any other card: Sagitta 
(Arrow); la Casa del Diavolo (House of the Devil); Fulmine (Lightning); Fuoco (Fire); la Casa del   
        Danato           (House of the Damned); Inferno (Hell);          la          C         asa 
di           Plutone           (House of Pluto); la           Foudre           (Lightning) and      
     la Maison Dieu          (the House of God, or ‘God House’).                        The 
last of these names was used in the Tarot de Marseilles, which heavily influenced the Golden Dawn, 
and in turn the work of Crowley. While all the other names in Italian refer to fiery things, hell, 
the underworld etc., and the idea of lightning even carries over into one of the early French 
decks, this last term is the most curious, and yet the most fitting for our purpose.   The French 
term is usually translated as the House of God, but since grammar rules were not fixed in those 
early days, the name can also be God House. And this term has a specific meaning in medieval 
France. A ‘God House’ was a place of refuge, a hospital for poor pilgrims, a place of sanctuary 
and comfort. It might even refer to a Church, a place to encounter the Divine Spirit.               
          It is precisely this function of the God House that is the purpose of the Adyton. While 
it most certainly can be the home of fire and lightning, these forces           are emanated        
              from within          the Tower, not struck by it from above. And the reason these 
forces do so is because the Adept is within the Tower, taking refuge from the world, and communing 
with their Angel. The Tower is therefore the Temple, and in this essay that Temple has been 
described in the utmost detail. The components of the Temple are both simple and complex: 4 Pillars 
of the elements and the Sphinxes; a Cubical Altar that is in 4 dimensions; and a 4-sided 
polyhedron, sliced off to make a seat for the Adept, surrounded by the 7 walls, and the heptagonal 
floor with its letters of power, and the heptagonal ceiling with its heptagram of enlightenment. 
For Lightning is one of the most appropriate of names for the Tower, in respect of the fact that 
the Tower is a 7-sided prism, designed to refract and convey the messages of the Star Goddess.      
                  Whether it is called the Adyton of the 7, the Vault of the Adepts, the Well of 
the Seven, or the Bastion, it is still the same building with the same purpose: a fortress of 
refuge for weary wanderers, and a place where the science of Trigrammaton mixes with the Art of the 
Aeon.                        The Tower is a recurring theme in the Holy Books of M.I.X., and many 
of the details of its construction and purpose can be found in these scriptures.           All of   
        these details of the Tower have been worked out thoroughly in this outstanding compilation. 
Frater M.G. has collated an immense amount of data to form the basis of the science of the Adyton. 
And what the Adept does within this space is the Art of our           gnosis          . May this 
essay serve the Adept well, in their journey of discovery through the labyrinth of time, and the 
sweet mastery of the Space of MA.                        I thoroughly endorse this           essay, 
and           consider it the equivalent of the required thesis of a Magister           Templi      
             8               3         , the Grade which Frater M.G. has attained, and which he has 
duly earned by his unflagging devotion to the Work.                      Omega Logion
