# The Geometry of the Time Spiral

## 1. The Mystic Spine (Column 7)
The central column (Tone 7) is the **Axis of Stability**.
Looking at the Delta values from the Bottom (Row 9) upwards:
*   Row 9: 56 ($2 \times 28$)
*   Row 8: 112 ($4 \times 28$)
*   Row 7: 168 ($6 \times 28$)
*   Row 6: 224 ($8 \times 28$)
*   Row 5: 280 ($10 \times 28$)
*   Row 4: 336 ($12 \times 28$)

**The Law**: The Axis vibrates at the **Frequency of 28**.
This connects the 260-day Tzolkin to the **28-Day Lunar Cycle** through the central wormhole.

## 2. The Outer Shell (Column 1)
The edge of the galaxy (Tone 1) is high-energy flux.
From Row 9 upwards:
*   Row 9: 45
*   Row 8: 99 (+54)
*   Row 7: 153 (+54)
*   Row 6: 207 (+54)
*   Row 5: 261 (+54)
*   Row 4: 315 (+54)

**The Law**: The Shell vibrates at the **Frequency of 54** ($2 \times 27$).
This represents the **Binary Cube** ($2 \times 3^3$).

## 3. The Polar Anomaly (The Bend in Space-Time)
The perfect arithmetic progression of the Outer Shell **fractures** at Row 3.
*   Row 4: 315
*   Row 3: 342 (+27) -> *Half Step*
*   Row 2: 288 (-54) -> *Inversion*

**The Physics**: Row 3 corresponds to **Sign 4 (Kan)**.
In our earlier Charge Analysis, Sign 4 was identified as the **Maximum Positive Charge (+6)** of the system.
**Conclusion**: The Magnetic Pole physically **warps** the Spiral Tension, breaking the linear progression. The Tzolkin is not a flat grid; it is a **Curved Field**.
