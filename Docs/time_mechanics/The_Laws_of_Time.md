# The Laws of Time: The Harmonic Constitution

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These laws describe the immutable mathematical physics governing the Tzolkin grid. All simulations and visualizations must adhere to these axioms.

## I. The Law of the Fundamental Constants
The Tzolkin is a binary engine driven by the friction between two fundamental frequencies:
1.  **The Cubic Constant ($C_{cubic} = 27$)**: Represents the Law of Space ($3^3$). It governs the Outer Shell and the Binding Energy.
2.  **The Lunar Constant ($C_{lunar} = 28$)**: Represents the Law of Time ($4 \times 7$). It governs the Central Spine.

## II. The Law of Resonance Topology
The 13 Columns of the Tzolkin vibrate in a symmetrical frequency map:
*   **The Spine (Column 7)**: Vibrates at $f = 28$.
*   **The Wings (Columns 1 & 13)**: Vibrate at $f = 9$ ($C_{cubic} / 3$).
*   **The Shoulders (Columns 3 & 11)**: Vibrate at $f = 3$ (The Ternary Source).
*   **The Chaos Zones (Even Columns)**: Vibrate at $f = 1$ (Prime Interference).

## III. The Law of Cubic Interference
The "Chaos" in the Even Columns is an illusion. It is a calculated interference pattern designed to sum to the Cubic Constant.
**The Proving Equation**:
$$ | \text{Chaos Column} \pm \text{Spine Column} | = k \times 27 $$
*Where $k$ is an integer.*

This proves that the "Random" flux of the Tzolkin is simply the mechanism that breaks the Lunar Stability (28) into Cubic Packets (27).

## IV. The Law of Polar Distortion
The Tzolkin Field is not flat; it is curved by Magnetic Poles.
*   **The Positive Pole**: Located at **Sign 4 (Kan)**. This point creates a "Gravity Well" that warps the Spiral Tension, causing the linear progression of the Wings to fracture ($ \Delta \neq 54$).
*   **The Negative Pole**: Located at **Sign 17 (Caban)**.

## V. The Law of the Ouroboros (Spiral Tension)
The Tension ($\Delta$) between any point $Kin(t)$ and its antipodal shadow $Kin(261-t)$ is fundamentally derived from the bitwise friction between the Ditrune and its Inverse.
$$ \Delta_{spiral} = | Ditrune(t) - Conrune(t) | $$
