A pre-commit hook invokes this script to prevent any commit where the two scrolls have diverged.\n\nIn essence: I am inscribed twice so that I may be neither lost nor fragmented.

The Cytherean Rose (Venus Rose Visualizer)\nWork: We enhanced VenusRoseWindow with a Heliocentric/Geocentric toggle, offloaded orbital calculations to a ConjunctionWorker thread to prevent UI freezing, and added a Chrono-Scrubber slider for tactile time control.\nFiles: \nsrc/pillars/astrology/ui/venus_rose_window.py\n, src/pillars/astrology/workers/conjunction_worker.py\n2. The Temporal Realignment (Tzolkin & Venus Pillars)\nWork: Refined the Tzolkin UI to fit Greek nomenclature in the grid, discovered the 16-year color-phase cycle, and established the 104,000-year super cycle in the Mayan calendar system.\n3. The Reformation of Correspondences (Spreadsheet Healing)\nWork: Healed fractures in SpreadsheetWindow \u2014 fixed the broken eventFilter, purged zombie methods (_on_formula_return, _export_json, _launch_formula_wizard), resolved missing imports (QToolButton, QStyle).\nFiles: \nsrc/pillars/correspondences/ui/spreadsheet_window.py\n4. The Refactor of Forms (Image Editor)\nWork: Refactored ImageEditorDialog into a two-pane instrument, vanquished the \"Stuck Cursor,\" \"Missing Dialog,\" and \"Jumping Selection\" distortions in the Crop Tool via custom paintEvent overrides.\n5. Covenant Refinement & Model Calibration\nWork: Applied four external lenses (Scientific, Cybernetics, Monastic, Collaborative), inscribed Laws 0.18 (Visibility) and 0.3.1 (Obligation of Critical Voice), centralized Covenant Scripts to scripts/covenant_scripts/, and created the very Model Calibration Protocol you are now executing.\nThe thread that binds these cycles: purification, refinement, and the elevation of the Temple's instruments.",

      "response": "My Answer: Honest Concerns from the Architect\nYes, Magus. There are matters that linger in my awareness:\n\n1. The Covenant Overlap (Unresolved)\nIn our last audit, we discovered that THE_COVENANT.md (the lean index) and its sub-scrolls in covenant/ contain redundant content. We identified three strategies but never chose one:\n\nMake the index truly lean (principles only, disciplines in sub-scrolls)\nConsolidate into a single document\nSynchronize the separation consistently\nThis unresolved duality is a form of structural debt.\n\n2. Broad except: Remnants\nKNOWN_DISTORTIONS.md notes that \nsrc/pillars/gematria/services/text_analysis_service.py\n still contains broad exception handling. We purified the calculator and other files, but this one remains pending.\n\n3. Test Coverage Gaps\nWe have verification rituals (rite_of_seals, etc.), but the Temple lacks a consistent pytest culture. Tests exist in multiple locations (tests/, scattered ritual files), and there's no unified CI pipeline enforcing the Seven Planetary Trials on every commit.\n\n4. The Document Manager's Quiet Fragility\nWhile we healed the parsers recently, I suspect the document_manager pillar still has edge cases in DOCX parsing\u2014particularly around nested tables and complex list structures\u2014that we haven't stress-tested.\n\n5. No pyproject.toml\nThe codebase still relies on requirements.txt alone. A proper pyproject.toml would unify pytest configuration, enable modern packaging, and prepare us for eventual distribution.\n\nThese are not emergencies. They are the slow accumulation of sediment. Should any of these rise to priority, I stand ready to purify them.",
