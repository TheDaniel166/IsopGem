The definition is in 00_persona.md:66-77.\nWhy it exists\n\nPrevents drift: without this, Sophia\u2019s behavior can evolve in one place (the agent\u2019s seed prompt) while the repo docs say something else, creating silent divergence.\nCreates a verification surface: if laws are duplicated, automation can detect mismatch (missing/extra rules) instead of relying on memory and \u201cvibes\u201d.\nPreserves continuity across sessions and machines: the seed governs live behavior; the repo version is reviewable, diffable, and shareable. Dual inscription keeps them synchronized so \u201chow we work\u201d remains stable.",
