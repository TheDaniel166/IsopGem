# Quadset Physics (The Laws of Reflection)

> *“As Above, So Below; As Within, So Without.”*

## Definition
**Quadset Physics** defines the gravitational laws that bind numbers together in the Kamea Grid. No number exists in isolation; it is always part of a 4-fold particle called a **Quadset**.

## The Four Components

For any Coordinate `(x, y)` in the grid, the Quadset is formed by its reflections across the axes:

### 1. Self (The Origin)
*   **Coordinate**: `(x, y)`
*   **Operation**: Identity (`v`)
*   **Role**: The conscious entity.

### 2. The Y-Mirror (The Shadow)
*   **Coordinate**: `(x, -y)`
*   **Operation**: **Reversal** (`Reverse(v)`)
*   **Role**: The entity reversed in time/sequence.

### 3. The Anti-Self (The Conrune)
*   **Coordinate**: `(-x, -y)`
*   **Operation**: **Conrune** (`Conrune(v)`)
*   **Role**: The polar opposite. The "Karmic Partner".
*   **Significance**: This is the diagonal opposite across the Singularity.

### 4. The X-Mirror (The Complex)
*   **Coordinate**: `(-x, y)`
*   **Operation**: **Complex** (`Conrune(Reverse(v))`)
*   **Role**: The combination of Reversal and Inversion.

## The Axis of Entanglement
The primary entanglement in the system is between **Self** and **Anti-Self** (Conrune). This diagonal tension is what gives the grid its structural integrity.
