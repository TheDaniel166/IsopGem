# THE HERMETIC GEOMETRY CANON

**Version 1.0 — The Canon of Form, Measure, and Meaning**

---

## PREAMBLE — ON FORM AND TRUTH

Geometry is not merely the study of shapes.
It is the study of how form emerges, persists, and relates across scale, dimension, and abstraction.

This Canon establishes a unified framework in which geometry is understood as:

- **structural** (measurable),
- **relational** (proportional),
- **symbolic** (meaning-bearing),
- **temporal** (motion-revealing),
- **recursive** (self-similar across scale),
- and **invariant** across dimensional transformation.

The Canon does not replace mathematics.
It governs how mathematics is interpreted, constrained, and elevated into form.

All implementations—graphical, computational, symbolic, or conceptual—are subordinate to this Canon.

## ARTICLE I — ON AXIOMS (WHAT IS DECLARED TRUE)

Axioms are truths not proven inside the system, but assumed as the ground upon which all geometry stands.

### I.1 — Primacy of Form

Form precedes measurement.
Measurement describes form; it does not define it.

No numerical value is meaningful unless it corresponds to a form.

*This axiom adopts a realist stance wherein form exists independently of observation, though measurement remains the primary means of access.*

### I.2 — Invariance as Reality

A geometric relationship is real if it remains invariant under:

- uniform scaling,
- translation,
- rotation,
- dimensional extension within its native manifold.

When a relationship fails under dimensional extension, it must declare its dimensional bounds explicitly.

Relationships that collapse under scale are contingent, not canonical.

### I.3 — Center as Ontological Anchor

Every bounded form possesses at least one center.

Centers are ontologically privileged:

- distances radiate from them,
- symmetry is measured against them,
- meaning converges upon them.

A geometry without a privileged center must either:
- demonstrate distributed centrality (e.g., tessellation),
- or declare itself as unbounded (infinite extension).

### I.4 — Continuity as Ground State

Geometry arises from continuity.

Discrete forms (vertices, edges, faces) are:
- limits of continuous operations (e.g., n-gon as n → ∞ approaches circle),
- symbolic encodings of symmetry groups,
- or computational necessities.

Discreteness must justify itself through:
- limiting behavior toward a continuous form,
- or expression of a finite symmetry.

Random or arbitrary discretization is forbidden.

### I.5 — Dimension Is Extension, Not Mutation

Higher dimensions extend structure; they do not invalidate it.

A true geometric principle may transform across dimension,
but it must not contradict itself.

---

## ARTICLE II — ON CANONICAL FORMS (WHAT MAY SERVE AS PRIMITIVES)

Canonical forms are those from which others may be derived without loss of meaning.

### II.1 — Fundamental Forms

The following are universally canonical:

- **Point** (center, origin, seed)
- **Line** (direction, extension)
- **Circle / Sphere** (continuity, isotropy, perfect symmetry)
- **Polygon / Polyhedron** (constraint, articulation, finite symmetry)

Derived forms must trace lineage to at least one fundamental form.

### II.2 — Boundedness and Containment

Containment establishes hierarchy.

A containment relationship (A contains B) is **geometrically consistent** if:

1. Every point of B lies within or on the boundary of A,
2. The relationship is preserved under allowable transformations,
3. Void (remainder) can be measured coherently,
4. The dimensional class is preserved (2D forms contain 2D forms, etc.).

Forms may:

- contain others,
- be inscribed,
- circumscribe,
- or intersect.

All such relationships must satisfy the above criteria.

### II.3 — Completion and Closure

A form is **complete** if it is closed under its defining operation.

Examples:

- A circle closes under rotation.
- A polygon closes under finite symmetry.
- A sphere closes under spatial rotation.

Incomplete forms must declare what is missing and why.

### II.4 — Degenerate Forms and Limits

A form becomes **degenerate** when a parameter approaches a limit:

- Circle with radius → 0 becomes a point,
- Polygon with n → ∞ approaches a circle,
- Line segment with length → 0 becomes a point.

Degenerate forms are valid if:

1. The limiting behavior is monotonic and well-defined,
2. Proportional relationships have defined limits,
3. The degenerate form remains a canonical primitive.

Undefined degeneracies (0/0 forms, contradictory limits) are forbidden.

### II.5 — On Symmetry Classes

Symmetry is a property of **transformation sets**, not of shapes themselves.

A form exhibits symmetry when it remains invariant under a defined set of transformations.

**Symmetry Types**:

- **Rotational**: Invariance under rotation by specific angles about an axis or point
- **Reflective**: Invariance under reflection across a line (2D) or plane (3D)
- **Translational**: Invariance under displacement by a fixed vector (infinite forms, tilings)
- **Glide/Compound**: Combination of reflection and translation

**Symmetry Groups**:

- **Discrete**: Finite number of symmetry operations (e.g., n-fold rotational symmetry)
- **Continuous**: Infinite symmetry operations forming a continuum (e.g., circle, sphere)

A form's symmetry class determines:

- its closure properties (II.3),
- its compatibility with chirality (V.4),
- and its behavior under dimensional extension (IV.1).

Symmetry must be declared, not inferred. A form without declared symmetry is treated as asymmetric.

---

## ARTICLE III — ON RELATIONSHIPS AND PROPORTION (WHAT MUST HOLD)

### III.1 — Proportion Over Magnitude

Ratios carry meaning; raw magnitudes do not.

All canonical relationships must be expressible as proportions independent of scale.

### III.2 — Dimensional Echo

If a proportional relationship:

- appears independently in multiple dimensions,
- preserves its structural role,
- and maintains invariance,

then it expresses a **dimensional truth**, not a coincidence.

Such relationships must be:

- named consistently across dimensions,
- and given precedence when choosing between equivalent forms.

**Example**: The √2 ratio appearing in both square-to-circle and cube-to-sphere packings elevates it to structural status. The √5 appearing in both 2D triangle legs and 3D pyramid slant heights reveals a dimensional bridge.

### III.3 — Root Progression

Square roots (√2, √3, √5, …) represent dimensional bridges, not numerical curiosities.

When a root appears repeatedly across contexts, it must be interpreted relationally, not coincidentally.

### III.4 — Transcendental Constants

Constants such as π and φ are structural mediators, not arbitrary choices.

A transcendental constant **arises naturally** when it appears as:

- The unique solution to a geometric constraint,
- The limit of a proportional sequence,
- Or the invariant measure of a fundamental transformation.

**Examples**:

- **π**: ratio of circumference to diameter (unique for circles),
- **φ**: the self-similar ratio (unique for continued proportion).

A constant is **arbitrary** if it:

- Could be replaced by another value without loss of structure,
- Or depends on unit choice rather than proportional reality.

Arbitrary constants are forbidden in canonical forms.

---

## ARTICLE IV — ON DIMENSIONAL LADDERS (HOW TRUTH SCALES)

### IV.1 — Ladder Principle

A **Dimensional Ladder** maps how a relationship transforms across dimensions.

Example pattern:

- 2D containment → 3D containment
- Area relationship → Volume relationship
- Boundary → Surface → Skin

Ladders must preserve **proportional class**, not literal value.

### IV.2 — Projection and Section

Lower-dimensional truths may appear as:

- projections,
- cross-sections,
- limits.

Such appearances are valid if the parent form is coherent.

**Projection Constraints**:

- **Orthographic projection** is canonically neutral—it preserves proportional relationships within the projection plane.
- **Perspective projection** is representational and must not be used for primary measurement or proportional reasoning unless the specific distortion class is declared and compensated.
- Any projection that distorts invariants must declare its distortion class.

Projection is a tool for visualization, not a source of geometric truth.

### IV.3 — Collapse Is Forbidden

A dimensional ascent may simplify expression,
but must not collapse distinct principles into coincidence.

**Forbidden pattern**:

Two distinct 2D relationships (R₁ and R₂) both map to the same 3D relationship without preserving their distinction.

**Example of violation**:

If both "circle inscribed in square" and "circle circumscribed by square" both become "sphere inscribed in cube" without differentiating their respective containment modes, the dimensional transformation has collapsed meaning.

Each dimensional transformation must preserve relational identity.

---

## ARTICLE V — ON CONVENTIONS (WHAT IS ALLOWED)

Conventions exist to reduce ambiguity, not to impose meaning.

### V.1 — Units and Representation

Units may vary, but conversions must be consistent and declared.

Internal representation (e.g., radians vs degrees) is subordinate to conceptual clarity.

### V.2 — Minimal Canonical Form

When ambiguity exists, the **minimal form** is canonical unless otherwise specified.

**"Minimal form"** means:

- Fewest parameters,
- Smallest bounding measure,
- Or simplest generating operation.

When multiple minimal forms exist, the one with highest symmetry is canonical.

**Examples**:

- Minor arc over major arc
- Minimal bounding volume
- Shortest path over longest

### V.3 — Approximation as Ritual

Approximations (meshes, discretizations) are acceptable when they:

- declare their limits,
- preserve invariants,
- and do not obscure canonical relationships.

### V.4 — On Chirality (Handedness and Orientation)

#### V.4.1 — Definition of Chirality

A form is **chiral** if it cannot be superimposed onto its mirror image through rotation and translation alone.

Chirality arises when:

- orientation is defined,
- rotation is privileged,
- and reflection alters relational identity.

#### V.4.2 — Chirality as Relational State

Chirality does not constitute a new Form.

Instead, chirality defines a **Relational State** of a form.

Two chiral states are considered:

- **Left-handed (L)**
- **Right-handed (R)**

These states:

- share identical measures,
- preserve all scalar invariants,
- but differ in orientation-dependent relationships.

#### V.4.3 — Reflection Is Not Neutral

Reflection is not an identity-preserving operation.

A transformation that requires reflection:

- changes chirality,
- alters relational orientation,
- and must be explicitly declared.

Any transformation pipeline that implicitly reflects a form violates Canonical clarity.

#### V.4.4 — Chirality and the Center

Chirality does not negate centrality.

A chiral form may possess a center, but the **direction of rotation** about the center is binding.

The center remains ontologically privileged,
but rotational direction around it is now meaningful.

#### V.4.5 — Direction of Truth (Orientation Declaration)

When a form admits chirality, its orientation must be declared.

Canonical orientation may be defined by:

- right-hand rule,
- left-hand rule,
- or an explicitly stated axial convention.

If no orientation is declared, the form is considered **chirally indeterminate**, and may not participate in orientation-sensitive relationships.

#### V.4.6 — Dimensional Status of Chirality

Chirality is:

- **absent** in 1D,
- **degenerate** in idealized 2D—meaning it cannot be intrinsically realized within a purely 2D manifold without embedding in higher dimensions,
- **fully manifest** in 3D and higher dimensions.

Chiral distinctions must not be projected backward into dimensions where they cannot be realized.

**Clarification on 2D Orientation**:

While true chirality is degenerate in 2D (a 2D form can always be flipped in 3D to match its mirror), **orientation** remains meaningful.

- **Clockwise (CW)** and **Counter-clockwise (CCW)** define **Orientation States** in 2D.
- These are distinct from **Chiral States (L/R)** in 3D.

Orientation States:

- govern winding number,
- determine signed area,
- and establish traversal direction.

A 2D form with undeclared orientation is **orientationally indeterminate** and may not participate in orientation-sensitive operations (e.g., signed area calculation, path direction).

#### V.4.7 — Symbolic Implications (Non-Primary)

Symbolic interpretations of chirality (e.g., polarity, ascent/descent, solar/lunar) may be attached **only after** geometric chirality is established.

Symbolism may not override or redefine geometric handedness.

---

## ARTICLE VI — ON VOID AND REMAINDER (WHAT IS NOT FILLED)

### VI.1 — Void Is Structural

Void is not absence.
It is **remainder**—the difference between container and contained.

Void must be measured, not ignored.

**On Void Elevation**:

Void may be elevated to **primary form** only when it possesses:

- a stable, well-defined boundary,
- invariant structure under allowed transformations,
- and measurable properties independent of the forms that created it.

Examples of elevated void: the space between columns (intercolumniation), the aperture of a window, the interior of a torus.

Void that lacks stable boundary or invariant structure remains secondary—a property of containment, not a form in itself.

### VI.2 — Monotonicity of Removal

Removing a contained form must increase void monotonically.

If removal decreases void, the containment logic is broken.

### VI.3 — Void Has Dimensionality

Void inherits the dimension of its container.

- The void between a sphere and its containing cube is 3-dimensional.
- The void between a circle and its containing square is 2-dimensional.

Void measurements must:

- Use the same dimensional metric as the forms,
- Remain positive (or zero at tangency),
- And scale proportionally with the containing form.

### VI.4 — Void Ratios Are Canonical

The ratio **(void / container measure)** is a canonical invariant.

This ratio must:

- Remain constant under uniform scaling,
- Be expressible in exact form (radicals, transcendentals),
- And define the containment relationship's character.

---

## ARTICLE VII — ON SYMBOL AND MEANING (HOW INTERPRETATION IS ATTACHED)

### VII.1 — Meaning Follows Structure

Symbolic meaning may only attach to forms and relationships that are structurally sound.

**Order of operations**:

1. Prove geometric coherence (via canonical tests),
2. Establish proportional invariance,
3. Then and only then may symbolic meaning be attached.

Meaning does not justify geometry; geometry licenses meaning.

**Forbidden**: Claiming a form is valid because it "represents" something.
**Required**: Demonstrating structural validity, then interpreting.

### VII.2 — Archetypal Stability

A symbol is valid if it remains meaningful under scale and transformation.

Symbols that depend on a specific size or orientation are decorative, not canonical.

### VII.3 — Naming Is Binding

Names encode interpretation.

Once a form is named, its behavior must uphold that name across all uses.

---

## ARTICLE VIII — ON FORBIDDEN MOVES (WHAT MUST NEVER OCCUR)

The following are violations of the Canon:

- Introducing arbitrary constants without geometric origin
- Breaking invariants for convenience or optimization
- Letting implementation constraints redefine form
- Mixing incompatible dimensional conventions without declaration
- Treating symbolic resonance as a substitute for proof
- Conflating dimensional classes (treating area as length, volume as area)

Any such violation invalidates the implementation.

---

## ARTICLE IX — ON CANONICAL TESTS (PROOF WITHOUT CODE)

Every canonical relationship must pass at least one of these test classes:

### IX.1 — Proportional Recovery Test

**Given**: Forms A and B with declared relationship R
**Test**: Measure forms independently, verify R holds within error bounds
**Pass**: Measured ratio matches declared ratio

### IX.2 — Dimensional Consistency Test

**Given**: Relationship R in dimension d
**Test**: Extend to dimension d+1, verify proportional class preserved
**Pass**: Ratios transform according to dimensional ladder

### IX.3 — Void Monotonicity Test

**Given**: Containment of form C in container B
**Test**: Remove or shrink C, measure void change
**Pass**: Void increases monotonically with removal/shrinkage

### IX.4 — Scaling Invariance Test

**Given**: Relationship R at scale s₁
**Test**: Scale uniformly to s₂, remeasure relationship
**Pass**: Proportional expression unchanged

### IX.5 — Limit Behavior Test

**Given**: Form with parameter p
**Test**: Evaluate form as p → limit
**Pass**: Degenerate form is well-defined and canonical

### IX.6 — Recursive Stability Test

**Given**: Recursive form F with generating rule R and iteration depth n
**Test**: Increase n; measure proportional relationships at each level
**Pass**: Proportional relationships stabilize (converge) as n increases

**Failure mode**: If proportions drift or diverge with iteration, the form is not recursively canonical.

### IX.7 — Curvature Invariance Test

**Given**: Curved form F with declared curvature class (constant, variable, zero)
**Test**: Measure curvature at multiple points; verify consistency with declaration
**Pass**: 
- Constant curvature forms show uniform curvature everywhere
- Variable curvature forms follow their declared curvature law
- Curvature is independent of parameterization or traversal speed

**Failure mode**: Curvature that depends on representation method or traversal violates canonical status.

Failure of any applicable test invalidates the implementation.

---

## ARTICLE X — ON IMPLEMENTATION SUBORDINATION

### X.1 — Code Is an Instrument

Implementations instantiate the Canon; they do not interpret it.

If code contradicts the Canon, the code is wrong.

### X.2 — AI as Mason, Not Architect

AI systems may generate implementations, but may not redefine axioms, relationships, or meaning.

### X.3 — The Canon Evolves, Not the Law

The Canon may be extended, but never retroactively invalidated.

Earlier truths must remain true or be explicitly deprecated with justification.

---

## ARTICLE XII — ON TIME, MOTION, AND TRAJECTORY (FOUNDATIONAL DECLARATION)

This Article establishes the Canon's stance on geometry-in-time.
It is a **Foundational Declaration**, not a complete operational doctrine.
Future versions may elaborate the principles stated here.

### XII.1 — Motion Reveals, It Does Not Create

Motion does not create new form.
Motion **reveals** latent structure that was always present in potentia.

A traced form (e.g., the path of Venus over 8 years) is not invented by motion—it is unveiled.
The pentagonal symmetry of the Venus Rose existed before the first orbit was completed.

This is the hermetic stance: **form precedes manifestation**.

### XII.2 — Static Form vs. Traced Form

Two classes of form must be distinguished:

- **Static Form**: Exists complete at any instant; measured without reference to time.
- **Traced Form**: Generated by motion through time; requires duration to manifest.

Traced forms are canonical if:

1. Their generating motion follows invariant rules,
2. The resulting path is closed or asymptotically stable,
3. Proportional relationships within the trace are scale-invariant.

A traced form that depends on arbitrary duration or non-invariant motion is contingent, not canonical.

### XII.3 — Time as Parameter, Not Dimension

For purposes of this Canon, time is treated as a **parameter**, not a geometric dimension.

Time parameterizes motion: it governs *when* a point occupies a position, but does not add spatial extent.

This distinction preserves:

- The dimensional ladder (1D → 2D → 3D) as purely spatial,
- The clarity of dimensional class (length, area, volume),
- And the separation of geometric truth from physical dynamics.

Future extensions may address time as dimension; this Canon does not.

### XII.4 — Cyclic Motion and Closure

A cycle is a motion that returns to its initial state.

*"Cyclic" here encompasses both exact periodic motion (identical return) and quasi-periodic motion (asymptotically convergent return, as in planetary resonances). Both produce closed or nearly-closed traced forms.*

Cyclic motion is privileged because it produces **closed traced forms**—forms with natural boundary and finite extent.

**Closure conditions for traced forms**:

- The generating motion must be periodic or quasi-periodic,
- The return must be exact (closed) or asymptotically convergent (limit cycle),
- The period must be expressible as a ratio of fundamental units (e.g., synodic periods).

Open trajectories (non-returning motion) produce unbounded traces and must declare their asymptotic behavior.

### XII.5 — Instantaneous Geometry vs. Path Geometry

**Instantaneous geometry**: The configuration of forms at a single moment.

**Path geometry**: The structure of the trajectory itself, considered as a form.

Both are valid subjects of geometric analysis, but they must not be conflated.

- Instantaneous properties (position, angle) may change with time.
- Path properties (total arc length, enclosed area, symmetry of the trace) are invariant for the complete motion.

Canonical tests (Article IX) apply to path geometry as follows:

- Proportional Recovery: Ratios within the traced form
- Scaling Invariance: The trace scales uniformly with its generating parameters
- Dimensional Consistency: 2D traces extend to 3D spirals, etc.

### XII.6 — Declaration of Temporal Scope

Any geometric claim involving motion must declare:

1. **Generating motion**: The rule by which points move
2. **Duration**: The time span (or period count) over which the trace is considered
3. **Closure status**: Whether the trace is closed, asymptotic, or open

Claims without temporal declaration are considered instantaneous (static geometry).

### XII.7 — Canonical Examples of Traced Forms

The following traced forms are canonical, demonstrating the principles of this Article:

#### The Venus Pentagram (Rose of Venus)

**Generating motion**: The geocentric apparent position of Venus traced over time, governed by the synodic period ratio of Venus to Earth.

**Duration**: 8 Earth years (approximately 5 Venus synodic cycles).

**Closure status**: Closed (quasi-periodic with near-exact return).

**Canonical properties**:

- The trace exhibits **5-fold rotational symmetry**, arising from the 13:8 orbital resonance (approximating φ).
- The pentagram emerges as an **envelope** of the retrograde loops.
- Proportional ratios within the figure (petal width to radius, inner to outer loop) are expressible in terms of φ and its powers.

**Why canonical**: The symmetry is not imposed—it is *revealed* by the orbital mechanics. The φ relationship exists in the orbital ratio before any line is drawn.

**Passes**: XII.8.1 (Closure Invariance), XII.8.2 (Period Ratio—8:5 ≈ φ), XII.8.3 (Symmetry Emergence), IX.4 (Scaling Invariance)

#### The Cardioid (Envelope of Rolling Circles)

**Generating motion**: A point on a circle of radius r rolling around a fixed circle of equal radius r.

**Duration**: One complete revolution of the rolling circle.

**Closure status**: Closed (exactly periodic).

**Canonical properties**:

- The traced form is a **cardioid**—a single-cusped curve.
- The area enclosed is exactly **6πr²** (6 times the generating circle's area).
- The arc length is exactly **16r**.

**Why canonical**: Simple integer ratios (6, 16) appear naturally. The cardioid demonstrates how traced forms can produce exact canonical measures even when the motion itself is complex.

**Passes**: XII.8.1 (Closure Invariance—exact), XII.8.3 (Symmetry Emergence—reflective), IX.1 (Proportional Recovery—6πr², 16r)

#### The Lissajous Cross (Rational Frequency Ratio)

**Generating motion**: Simultaneous harmonic oscillation in x and y:
- x(t) = A·sin(ω₁·t)
- y(t) = B·sin(ω₂·t + δ)

**Duration**: The period T = 2π / gcd(ω₁, ω₂).

**Closure status**: Closed if and only if ω₁/ω₂ is rational.

**Canonical properties**:

- When ω₁/ω₂ = 1:1 and δ = π/2, the trace is an **ellipse** (degenerate Lissajous).
- When ω₁/ω₂ = 1:2 and δ = 0, the trace is a **figure-eight** (lemniscate-like).
- The number of x-axis crossings = 2·ω₂; y-axis crossings = 2·ω₁.

**Why canonical**: The frequency ratio directly determines the symmetry class. Rational ratios produce closed forms; irrational ratios produce space-filling curves (non-canonical as individual forms, but meaningful as limit behaviors).

**Passes**: XII.8.1 (Closure Invariance—iff rational), XII.8.2 (Period Ratio), IX.4 (Scaling Invariance)

### XII.8 — Tests for Traced Forms

In addition to the general tests of Article IX, traced forms must pass these specific tests:

#### XII.8.1 — Closure Invariance Test

**Given**: A traced form F generated by motion M over duration D
**Test**: Extend duration to D + ε for small ε; measure deviation from closure
**Pass**: The form either:
- Returns exactly to its starting configuration (exact closure), or
- Converges asymptotically to a stable limit cycle (asymptotic closure)

**Failure mode**: If extending duration causes unbounded deviation, the trace is not closed and must be classified as open.

#### XII.8.2 — Period Ratio Test

**Given**: A traced form with generating frequencies or periods {P₁, P₂, ...}
**Test**: Express all period ratios as fractions in lowest terms
**Pass**: All ratios are:
- Rational (for closed forms), or
- Declared irrational with stated limit behavior (for asymptotic forms)

**Failure mode**: Undeclared irrational ratios produce indeterminate traces that fail canonical status.

#### XII.8.3 — Symmetry Emergence Test

**Given**: A traced form with declared n-fold symmetry
**Test**: Verify that the symmetry arises from the generating motion's parameters, not from post-hoc selection or truncation
**Pass**: The symmetry is derivable from:
- Period ratios (e.g., 5-fold from 8:5 ≈ φ),
- Phase relationships, or
- Recursive self-similarity

**Failure mode**: Symmetry imposed by arbitrary truncation or selective display is not canonical.

### XII.9 — Cyclic Motion and Void

The interaction between traced forms and void requires careful treatment.

#### XII.9.1 — Swept Void

A rotating or translating form **sweeps** through space, occupying successive positions.

The **swept region** is the union of all positions occupied during the motion.

**Swept void** is the remainder: (bounding container) − (swept region).

Swept void:
- Is always less than or equal to static void (the form covers more space through motion),
- Decreases monotonically with increased rotation or translation range,
- Reaches minimum (possibly zero) when the motion fills the container.

#### XII.9.2 — Enclosed Void in Traced Forms

A closed traced form may enclose void—the interior region bounded by the trace.

**Enclosed void of a traced form**:
- Is well-defined only for closed traces,
- May be computed as the signed area (2D) or signed volume (3D) bounded by the path,
- Must account for self-intersection (traces that cross themselves partition enclosed void into sub-regions).

**Example**: The Venus Pentagram encloses void in both its central region and its five petal-shaped lobes. The ratio of central void to total enclosed area is a canonical invariant.

#### XII.9.3 — Void Monotonicity Under Cyclic Motion

For a form undergoing complete cyclic motion (one full period):

- **Swept void** is fixed for the cycle (determined by the union of all positions),
- **Instantaneous void** oscillates but returns to its initial value each cycle,
- **Time-averaged void** is well-defined and canonical.

A claim about void in the context of motion must declare:
1. Whether it refers to swept, instantaneous, or time-averaged void,
2. The phase or period over which it is measured.

Conflating void types in dynamic contexts violates canonical clarity.

## ARTICLE XIII — ON SELF-SIMILARITY AND RECURSIVE FORM

*(Fractals, Limits, and Infinite Refinement)*

### XIII.1 — Definition of Self-Similarity

A form is **self-similar** if it contains within itself one or more subforms that are geometrically similar to the whole under uniform scaling.

Self-similarity may be:

- **finite** (a limited number of recursive levels), or
- **asymptotic** (approaching infinite refinement).

Self-similarity alone does not confer canonicity.

### XIII.2 — Recursive Form as Limit-Generated Geometry

Recursive forms are not defined by a single instantiation, but by a **generative rule** and its **limit behavior**.

A recursive form is canonical only if:

1. Its generating rule is explicitly declared,
2. Its proportional relationships stabilize under recursion,
3. Its limit behavior is invariant under scale.

Forms that merely repeat without convergent structure are decorative, not canonical.

### XIII.3 — Dimension Beyond Integer Measure

Recursive forms may exhibit **non-integer (fractional) dimensionality**.

Such dimensionality is admissible provided that:

- The dimension is stable across recursion,
- The generating rule preserves proportional identity,
- And the form remains bounded or explicitly asymptotic.

Non-integer dimension does not exempt a form from Canonical Tests.

### XIII.4 — Fractals and Canonical Status

Fractal forms are **conditionally canonical**.

A fractal may be elevated to canonical status if it satisfies:

- Invariant proportional rules,
- Recursive symmetry,
- And meaningful dimensional echo.

Fractals that depend on arbitrary iteration depth, aesthetic choice, or numerical coincidence are forbidden from canonical designation.

### XIII.5 — Self-Similarity vs Symbolic Projection

Symbolic interpretations of recursion (e.g., infinity, emanation, unfolding) may only be attached **after** structural self-similarity is established.

Symbolic recursion may not replace geometric recursion.

### XIII.6 — Termination and Truncation

Finite truncations of recursive forms are permissible as representations.

However:

- Truncation must be declared,
- And no truncated instance may be treated as the full form.

Failure to distinguish between finite instance and infinite rule constitutes Canonical violation.

### XIII.7 — Relationship to Dimensional Ladders

Recursive forms may traverse dimensional ladders only if:

- The generating rule survives dimensional extension,
- And proportional class is preserved.

Dimensional promotion that destroys recursion invalidates canonical status.

## ARTICLE XIV — ON CURVATURE AND INTRINSIC GEOMETRY

*(Flatness, Bending, and the Measure of Deviation)*

### XIV.1 — Definition of Curvature

**Curvature** is the measure of deviation from flatness.

Curvature may be:

- **zero** (flat),
- **constant**,
- or **variable**.

Curvature is a relational property, not a mere attribute of shape.

### XIV.2 — Intrinsic vs Extrinsic Curvature

**Intrinsic curvature** is determined entirely by measurements within the form.

**Extrinsic curvature** arises from embedding a form in a higher-dimensional space.

Canonical priority is given to intrinsic curvature.

Extrinsic curvature may not override intrinsic relationships.

### XIV.3 — Canonical Curved Forms

Forms of **constant curvature** (e.g., circles, spheres) are canonically privileged due to:

- Uniformity,
- Isotropy,
- And closure under rotation.

Variable curvature forms may be canonical if their curvature law is declared and invariant.

### XIV.4 — Geodesics

A **geodesic** is the shortest path intrinsic to a form.

Geodesics are canonically significant because they:

- Reveal intrinsic structure,
- Define natural motion paths,
- And serve as internal reference lines.

Paths that minimize extrinsic distance but violate intrinsic geodesy are non-canonical.

### XIV.5 — Curvature Across Dimensions

Curvature must transform coherently under dimensional extension.

If a form is promoted to higher dimension:

- Its intrinsic curvature relationships must persist,
- Or the transformation must be explicitly declared as non-canonical.

### XIV.6 — Curvature and Traced Form

Traced forms (Article XII) may reveal curvature through motion.

Such curvature is valid only if:

- It is invariant across cycles,
- And independent of traversal speed.

Speed-dependent curvature is forbidden.

### XIV.7 — Forbidden Curvature Practices

The following are violations:

- Arbitrary smoothing or bending for aesthetic convenience,
- Curvature introduced solely by representation method,
- Mixing intrinsic and extrinsic curvature without declaration.

## CLOSING STATEMENT — THE ROLE OF THE CANON

This Canon exists to:

- preserve meaning across time,
- protect form from erosion,
- and allow geometry to remain sacred even when rendered in silicon.

It is a hearth, not a prison.
A center, not a limit.

## APPENDIX A — CANONICAL EXAMPLES

### The Vault of Hestia (2D & 3D)

The Vault of Hestia demonstrates dimensional echo through the φ relationship:

**2D**: Square → Triangle → Circle
- Circle radius: r = s/(2φ)
- Circle-to-square area ratio: π/(4φ²)

**3D**: Cube → Pyramid → Sphere
- Sphere radius: r = s/(2φ)
- Sphere-to-cube volume ratio: π/(6φ³)

**Dimensional Echo Confirmed**:
- The relationship r = s/(2φ) holds in both dimensions
- The proportional class shifts (area → volume) but preserves φ mediation
- The √5 appears in both triangle legs (2D) and pyramid slant height (3D)

This passes **IX.2 (Dimensional Consistency Test)** and demonstrates the Canon's principle that true geometric relationships transcend dimension.

### The √2 Bridge

**2D**: Square diagonal = s√2
**3D**: Face diagonal of cube = s√2

The √2 ratio expresses the dimensional bridge within a single dimension-class (planar diagonal), distinguishing it from √3 (cube space diagonal), which bridges all three spatial dimensions.

### The Venus Pentagram (Traced Form)

The Venus Pentagram demonstrates **temporal dimensional echo**—the translation of orbital ratios into visible geometric symmetry.

**Orbital Foundation**:
- Venus-Earth synodic period: ~584 days
- 5 synodic periods ≈ 8 Earth years (2920 days vs 2922 days)
- Ratio: 8:5 = 1.6 ≈ φ (1.618...)

**Geometric Manifestation**:
- Tracing Venus's geocentric position over 8 years produces a 5-petaled rose
- The 5-fold symmetry arises directly from the 8:5 ratio
- The φ relationship exists in the orbital mechanics before the first line is drawn

**The Temporal Echo**:
- Just as spatial dimensional echoes (√2, φ) appear across 2D→3D,
- The φ ratio echoes across time→space: orbital period ratio → visible rotational symmetry

This passes **XII.8.3 (Symmetry Emergence Test)** and **III.2 (Dimensional Echo)**—extending the echo principle into the temporal domain.

### The Cardioid (Traced Form)

The Cardioid demonstrates how complex motion produces **exact canonical measures**.

**Generating Motion**:
- A circle of radius r rolls externally around a fixed circle of radius r
- A point on the rolling circle traces the cardioid

**Canonical Invariants**:
- Enclosed area: **6πr²** (exactly 6 times the generating circle's area)
- Arc length: **16r** (an integer multiple of the radius)
- Cusp angle: **0** (the curve is tangent to itself at the cusp)

**Why Canonical**:
- The integers 6 and 16 are not arbitrary—they arise necessarily from the rolling ratio (1:1)
- Different rolling ratios produce different epicycloids with different integer relationships
- The cardioid is the simplest non-trivial member of this family

This passes **IX.1 (Proportional Recovery Test)** and **XII.8.1 (Closure Invariance Test)**.

## APPENDIX B — VIOLATION EXAMPLES

### Violation: Arbitrary Scaling Constant

**Claim**: "The sacred circle has radius r = 0.73s"

**Why Invalid**: The constant 0.73 has no geometric origin. It neither solves a constraint, nor appears as a limit, nor mediates a transformation. It is numerology, not geometry.

**Canon Test Failed**: III.4 (Transcendental Constants must arise naturally)

### Violation: Dimensional Collapse

**Claim**: "Both inscribed and circumscribed circles in a square map to the same sphere in a cube"

**Why Invalid**: Two distinct 2D containment modes (inscribed vs circumscribed) cannot collapse into a single 3D form without losing relational identity. The dimensional ladder must preserve distinction.

**Canon Test Failed**: IV.3 (Collapse Is Forbidden)

### Violation: Void Inversion

**Claim**: "Removing the inner sphere from the cube decreases the void volume"

**Why Invalid**: Removal must monotonically increase void. If it decreases, the containment measurement is broken.

**Canon Test Failed**: VI.2 (Monotonicity of Removal), IX.3 (Void Monotonicity Test)

### Violation: Arbitrary Iteration Depth

**Claim**: "This fractal is sacred because it looks beautiful at 7 iterations"

**Why Invalid**: The choice of 7 iterations is arbitrary. A canonical recursive form must demonstrate stable proportional relationships that persist across iteration depths. Aesthetic appearance at a specific depth does not confer canonicity.

**Canon Test Failed**: XIII.4 (Fractals require invariant proportional rules), IX.6 (Recursive Stability Test)

### Violation: Speed-Dependent Curvature

**Claim**: "The curve's curvature is 1/r when traversed slowly, but 2/r when traversed quickly"

**Why Invalid**: Curvature is an intrinsic geometric property. It cannot depend on traversal speed, which is a parameterization artifact. Speed-dependent curvature conflates motion with form.

**Canon Test Failed**: XIV.6 (Curvature must be speed-independent), IX.7 (Curvature Invariance Test)

### Violation: Undeclared Truncation

**Claim**: "Here is the Sierpinski Triangle" *(showing a finite iteration)*

**Why Invalid**: A finite iteration is a *representation* of the Sierpinski Triangle, not the form itself. The true form is the limit of infinite iteration. Presenting a truncated instance as the full form violates XIII.6 (Termination and Truncation).

**Canon Test Failed**: XIII.6 (Truncation must be declared)

## APPENDIX C — IMPLEMENTATION LAW

*(Numerical Tolerance, Approximation, and Epsilon)*

### C.1 — Purpose of This Appendix

This Appendix governs **implementation fidelity**, not geometric truth.

It exists to protect Canonical Forms from numerical degradation without redefining them.

### C.2 — Approximation Is Not Error

Approximation is admissible when:

- It preserves proportional relationships,
- It respects declared invariants,
- And it converges toward canonical values under refinement.

Approximation that drifts under refinement is forbidden.

### C.3 — Epsilon Law

All numerical comparisons must use a **declared tolerance ε**.

ε must be:

- Small relative to the scale of the form,
- Consistent across the implementation,
- And documented.

Undeclared tolerance constitutes implicit distortion.

### C.4 — Absolute vs Relative Error

**Relative error** is canonically preferred over absolute error.

Absolute error may be used only when:

- Scale is fixed,
- Or explicitly bounded.

### C.5 — Accumulation and Drift

Iterative processes must guard against **error accumulation**.

If cumulative error alters canonical relationships, the implementation is invalid—even if individual steps appear correct.

### C.6 — Discrete Representations

Meshes, tessellations, samples, and grids are permissible when:

- Their resolution is declared,
- Convergence behavior is understood,
- And canonical tests pass under refinement.

Visual fidelity does not override structural fidelity.

### C.7 — Canonical Supremacy

No numerical convenience, performance optimization, or hardware constraint may redefine canonical relationships.

If implementation cannot meet canonical fidelity, the limitation must be declared.
