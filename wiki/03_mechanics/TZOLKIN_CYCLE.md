The **Tzolkin Cycle** is the harmonic filter of the Time Mechanics pillar. It maps the linear progression of days onto a 260-day permuting matrix, revealing the hidden "spin" or quality of time.

## I. The Harmonic Matrix

### The 260-Day Cycle
The cycle is composed of two interlocking cogs:
1.  **Metric**: 260 Days.
2.  **Resonance**: 133 (The Mercury Current).
3.  **Frequency**: 13 Galactic Tones × 20 Solar Seals.

### The Ditrune
Every Kin (Day) in the cycle is associated with a **Ditrune**, a 6-digit ternary value (e.g., `012012`).
- **Digits**: 0, 1, 2.
- **Ternary Logic**: Used to calculate resonances and "Anti-Self" (Conrune) relationships.
- **Trigrams**: The Ditrune is split into Upper and Lower Trigrams for I-Ching style analysis.

## II. The Interactive Components

### 1. The Tzolkin Calculator
**Location**: `src/pillars/time_mechanics/ui/tzolkin_window.py`

A 20x13 Grid interface allowing navigation through the harmonic module.
- **Rows**: The 20 Solar Seals.
- **Columns**: The 13 Galactic Tones.
- **Function**: Click any cell to jump to that Kin. Displays the current Ditrune and Tone/Sign.

### 2. The Dynamis Engine
**Location**: `src/pillars/time_mechanics/ui/dynamis_window.py`

An animated visualization of the Tzolkin as an Ouroboros track.
- **Orbs**: Represents the **Self** (Current Kin) and **Conrune** (Anti-Self).
- **Motion**: Visualizes the distance and tension between the Self and the Shadow.

## III. Mathematical Foundations

*   **Epoch**: January 12, 2020 (Kin 1, Cycle 1).
*   **Total Sum**: The sum of all 260 Ditrune values is **82,992** (624 × 133).
*   **Mercury Link**: 
    - 45 Cycles = Mercury Orbital Period × 133.
    - 30 Cycles = Mercury Rotational Period × 133.
