# Time Mechanics: The Chronos Protocol

<!-- Last Verified: 2026-01-01 -->

> *"Time is not a line, but a lattice of resonating cycles."*

## The Sovereign Domain
The **Time Mechanics** pillar is the keeper of cycles and the calculator of harmonic time. Unlike Astrology, which observes the positions of celestial bodies, Time Mechanics observes the **quality** of time itself through mathematical and symbolic frameworks.

## The Three Great Cycles

### 1. The Tzolkin Cycle (260 Days)
*   **The Harmonic Filter**: A 260-day cycle resonating with the frequency of 133 (The Mercury Current).
*   **Structure**: 20 Solar Seals × 13 Galactic Tones.
*   **Concept**: Maps linear time to a 6-digit ternary **Ditrune** (0, 1, 2), revealing the hidden "spin" of reality.

### 2. The Thelemic Calendar (364 Days)
*   **The Solar Lattice**: A 364-day fixed calendar (+1 Intercalary Day) constructed from **Conrune Pairs**.
*   **Structure**: 52 Weeks, 4 Cardinal Gates.
*   **Concept**: Every day creates a tension between the Day-Self (Ditrune) and Night-Self (Contrune). The **Difference** between them determines the exact degree on the **Zodiacal Circle**.

### 3. The Eclipse Patterns (The Dragon's Breath)
*   **The Shadow Rhythm**: The cycle of Nodal Alignments (Rahu/Ketu).
*   **Concept**: Eclipses are not random; they follow the Saros sequences, marking the "heartbeats" of the cosmic dragon.

## Interactive Components

### The Dynamis Engine
An animated visualization of the Tzolkin cycle as an **Ouroboros Track**, showing the circulation of energy between the Self (Current Kin) and the Anti-Self (Conrune).

### The Zodiacal Circle
A 360° interactive wheel mapping the 364 Thelemic days to their zodiacal degrees.
*   **Outer Ring**: Zodiacal Signs (Aries to Pisces).
*   **Inner Ring**: Conrune Difference values.
*   **Core**: The tension of the current moment.
