Welcome, seeker, to the **Akaschic Archive**—the complete technical and philosophical record of the IsopGem system. This wiki contains:

- **Total File Coverage**: Every Python file in the repository is documented with its purpose, role, dependencies, consumers, and public interface.
- **Living Architecture**: The documentation is dynamically generated from the source code, ensuring it reflects the true state of the Temple.
- **Navigable Structure**: Use the Sidebar to explore the Five Halls of knowledge.
