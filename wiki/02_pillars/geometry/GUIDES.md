## 📐 How to Construct 2D Sacred Shapes

1.  Launch the **Geometry Hub** and open the **2D Construction Scene**.
2.  **Basic Tools**: Use the sidebar to select Circle, Line, or Polygon tools.
3.  **The Vesica Piscis**: 
    1.  Draw a circle.
    2.  Click the center of the first circle and drag to its edge to create a second, overlapping circle.
4.  **Snapping**: The scene uses "Sacred Snaps" to lock lines to centers, intersections, and midpoints.
5.  **Color Coding**: Right-click any element to change its color according to the **Visual Liturgy** palette (e.g., *Sovereign Gold*, *Abyssal Blue*).

## 🧊 How to Visualize 3D Platonic Solids

1.  Open the **3D Geometry Window**.
2.  **Select Solid**: Choose from Tetrahedron, Cube, Octahedron, Dodecahedron, or Icosahedron.
3.  **Rotation & Zoom**: Use the mouse to rotate the object in 3-dimensional space.
4.  **Vertex Analysis**: Hover over vertices to see their spatial coordinates and their relationship to the central point (The Bindu).
5.  **Duality View**: Turn on the "Dual" overlay to see the dual solid (e.g., Cube within an Octahedron) manifesting within the primary form.

## 🔢 How to Explore Polygonal Numbers

Visualize how numbers manifest as physical shapes.

1.  Open the **Polygonal Number Window**.
2.  **Select Type**: Choose Triangle, Square, Pentagonal, etc.
3.  **Iterate**: Use the slider to increase the "Rank" of the number.
4.  **Observe Accumulation**: Watch how the dots (The Monads) arrange themselves into consistent, growing patterns.

## 🧮 Using the Advanced Scientific Calculator

A specialized engine for high-precision geometric constants.

1.  Launch the **Scientific Calculator** from the Hub.
2.  **Constants**: Access pre-defined constants like **Phi (φ)**, **Pi (π)**, and the **Square Root of 2**.
3.  **Reciprocal Harmonics**: Use the specialized functions to analyze the reciprocal relationships between numbers and their geometric shadows.
