# Mods Pillar - Reference

<!-- Last Verified: 2026-01-03 -->

This pillar is currently a scaffold: the folder exists to reserve a place for modular extensions (“mods”), but there is no active implementation yet.

---

**Code Anchor:** `src/pillars/mods/`

**Expected Shape (when implemented):**
* `data/` (resources)
* `models/` (schemas)
* `services/` (mod loader / registry)
* `ui/` (mod management UI)
