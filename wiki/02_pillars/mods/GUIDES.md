# Mods Pillar - Guides

<!-- Last Verified: 2026-01-03 -->

This pillar is currently a scaffold: it exists as a placeholder for modular extensions (“mods”), but has no active Python implementation yet.

---

## What To Do Here (Current)

- Treat this as a design dock for future mod/plugin architecture.
- Keep notes about desired extension points (UI hooks, services, data models) in this folder until code exists.

## Where To Look In Code

- Folder scaffold: `src/pillars/mods/`
- When implementation begins, update this guide to point at the concrete entry windows/services.
