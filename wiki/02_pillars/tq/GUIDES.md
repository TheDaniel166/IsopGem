## 🔺 How to Analyze a Quadset

Analyze a number through its primary, secondary, and tertiary reductions.

1.  Open the **Quadset Analysis Window** from the TQ Hub.
2.  **Input Number**: Enter a decimal integer.
3.  **Process**: Click "Analyze".
4.  **Review Quadrants**:
    *   **Q1**: The initial number.
    *   **Q2**: The first reduction (The Soul).
    *   **Q3**: The second reduction (The Spirit).
    *   **Q4**: The final convergence (The Source).
5.  **Visualize**: Use the **Quadset Compass** to see the numerical "trajectory" as it descends toward unity.

## 🔢 How to Use the Ternary Converter

Convert decimal numbers into the specialized ternary (Base-3) logic used in TQ.

1.  Open the **Ternary Converter Window**.
2.  **Toggle Bits**: Manually click the ternary bits (0, 1, 2) to build a number, or enter a decimal to see its ternary equivalent.
3.  **Trinity Check**: Observe the balance between the three ternary states (The Father, Mother, and Child).
4.  **Sound Generation**: Use the **Ternary Sound Widget** to hear the "frequency" of the ternary string as a localized audio response.

## 🕸️ How to Generate a Kamea Grid

1.  Open the **Kamea Window**.
2.  **Select Planet**: Choose a planetary square (e.g., *Magic Square of the Sun* - 6x6).
3.  **Sigil Generation**: Enter a word or value to watch the application draw a "Sigil" on the grid based on the number-to-cell mapping.
4.  **Fractal Analysis**: Enable the **Fractal View** to see how the square propagates into self-similar sub-grids.

## 🌀 Visualizing Geometric Transitions

Observe how numbers mutate between different dimensional states.

1.  Launch the **Geometric Transitions Window**.
2.  **Set Initial State**: Enter a base number or set of coordinates.
3.  **Apply Operator**: Select a TQ operator (e.g., *The Nuclear Mutation*) to witness the transformation.
4.  **3D View**: Switch to the **Transitions 3D Window** to see the transition manifest as a geometric "folding" animation.
