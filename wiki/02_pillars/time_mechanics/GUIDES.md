## 📅 How to Navigate the Tzolkin Grid

1.  Open the **Time Mechanics Hub** and launch the **Tzolkin Window**.
2.  **The Matrix**: Observe the 20x13 grid of the Mayan Sacred Calendar.
3.  **Find Specific Kin**: Enter a Date in the "Gregorian" field to see its corresponding Tzolkin Kin (e.g., *11 Blue Spectral Monkey*).
4.  **Analyze Resonances**: Click on any cell in the grid to view its mathematical relationship to the current date and its primary "Portals" (Loom of Maya).

## ⭕ Analyzing the Zodiacal Circles

1.  Launch the **Zodiacal Circle Window**.
2.  **Select Circle**: Choose from the standard Zodiac, the Decans, or custom harmonic divisions.
3.  **Rotate the Wheels**: Use the mouse to rotate the inner and outer wheels to find specific alignments (e.g., *Sun in the 1st Decan of Aries*).
4.  **Aspect Overlays**: Toggle the aspect lines to see how specific degrees across the circle create geometric resonances (Trines, Squares, etc.).

## 🌀 Using the Dynamis Window

Observe time as a continuous, flowing force.

1.  Open the **Dynamis Window**.
2.  **The Flow**: Watch the real-time visualization of temporal "currents".
3.  **Set Velocity**: Adjust the speed to witness how cycles interact over hours, days, or years.
4.  **Marker Placement**: Place a "Temporal Anchor" on a specific moment to track its resonance with the moving present.
