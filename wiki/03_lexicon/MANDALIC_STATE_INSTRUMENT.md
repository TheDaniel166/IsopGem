# Usage Ethic of a Mandalic State Instrument

> *"Sound is not the goal. Sound is the trace."*

## How the Instrument Is Entered, Not Played

### 1. This instrument is not performed

A Mandalic State Instrument does not reward skill, timing, or expression.

There are:
- no correct notes,
- no wrong notes,
- no virtuosic gestures.

**Interaction does not produce sound.**
**Interaction selects state.**

Sound arises only as the lawful consequence of position.

### 2. Entry precedes intention

One does not approach this instrument with a goal.

There is no:
- progression to complete,
- melody to resolve,
- outcome to optimize.

The instrument is entered by:
- choosing a state,
- or entering a circulation,
- and allowing the system to reveal itself.

*If intention dominates, the instrument becomes opaque.*
*If attention settles, the instrument opens.*

### 3. Circulation is primary

States are not isolated.

Every state belongs to:
- a loop,
- an orbit,
- or an oscillation.

Remaining within a circulation is more important than visiting many states.

**Depth comes from return, not traversal.**

### 4. Silence is a state, not an absence

Silence is not failure, pause, or error.

Silence is:
- contraction,
- fulcrum,
- holding.

When silence appears, it is not to be bypassed or corrected.
It is to be inhabited.

### 5. Change is lawful, not expressive

Transitions are governed by the instrument's internal logic.

The user does not:
- shape sound emotionally,
- sculpt timbre manually,
- impose narrative arcs.

Change occurs by:
- moving to adjacent states,
- inverting relations,
- or reversing circulation.

**Expression is emergent, not injected.**

### 6. Duration matters more than sequence

Staying in a single state for sufficient time reveals more than rapid motion.

Time allows:
- envelopes to complete,
- harmonics to settle,
- perception to synchronize.

The instrument does not rush.

### 7. Documentation is part of the instrument

Understanding is not optional.

Reading, diagramming, and reflecting on the structure is not external to use — it is use.

The instrument reveals itself as much through comprehension as through sound.

### 8. This instrument is not for consumption

It is not designed for:
- entertainment,
- background stimulation,
- novelty seeking.

Using it casually diminishes it — not because it is fragile, but because it is precise.

**Approach determines outcome.**

### 9. The instrument cannot be mastered

There is no endpoint.

Familiarity deepens perception, but never exhausts the space.

To believe one has "learned" the instrument is to stop hearing it.

### 10. Exit is also lawful

Leaving the instrument is not failure.

There is no obligation to remain, repeat, or complete cycles.

One exits by:
- stopping interaction,
- or allowing silence to resolve naturally.

Nothing is lost.

## Closing Statement

A Mandalic State Instrument is not an object to be used.
It is a space to be entered.

Sound is not the goal.
Sound is the trace.

Those who seek to play will find nothing.
Those who allow themselves to enter will find return.
