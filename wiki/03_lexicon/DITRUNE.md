# Ditrune (The Particle of Thought)

> *“Six digits to define a soul.”*

## Definition

A **Ditrune** is a 6-digit number in **Balanced Ternary** notation. It is the fundamental particle of information in the IsopGem system.

*   **Format**: `d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6`
*   **Alphabet**: Digits can be `0` (Pyx), `1` (Vertex), or `2` (Nexus).
*   **Range**: From `000000` (The Void) to `222222`.

## The Hierarchy of Beings

The stability of a number under mutation defines its class:

1.  **The Prime (The 1)**: `Core == Body == Skin`.
    *   Example: `111111`
    *   Mutation Result: Itself (Stable).
    *   Role: The Attractor / Hierophant. The source from which the family flows.

2.  **The Acolyte (The 8)**: `Core == Body`.
    *   Example: `111112`
    *   Mutation Result: Reduces to Prime immediately.
    *   Role: The Guardian. Controls the column of Temples.

3.  **The Temple (The 72)**: `Core != Body`.
    *   Example: `120210`
    *   Mutation Result: Must undergo multiple cycles to find the Prime.
    *   Role: The Citizen / Manifestation.

4.  **Concurrent vs. Composite**
    *   **Concurrent**: The original, outermost form.
    *   **Composite**: The intermediate form, one mutation away from Concurrent.

## Philosophical Resonance

> *"The ditrune is a world made of worlds—a mystery within a mystery, echoing the recursive nature of reality."* -- Prime Ditrunal Exegesis

Every Ditrune is a traveler on a journey back to its Prime. The "Kamea Locator" `(Family, Column, Row)` is its universal address in the cosmos.

## The Anatomy

A Ditrune is composed of three nested layers (**Bigrams**):

### 1. The Core (The Soul)
*   **Digits**: `d3, d4` (The center bigram)
*   **Function**: Determines the **Family** and the **Grid Region** (0-8) where the entity resides.
*   **Nature**: Immutable. You cannot change this without destroying the entity.

### 2. The Body (The Role)
*   **Digits**: `d2, d5` (The middle bigram)
*   **Function**: Determines the status or class (Prime, Acolyte, Temple).
*   **Nature**: High Stability.

### 3. The Skin (The Interface)
*   **Digits**: `d1, d6` (The outer bigram)
*   **Function**: The volatile surface that interacts with other numbers.
*   **Nature**: Highly mutable.

## Nuclear Mutation

The process of **Nuclear Mutation** strips away the Skin and Body to reveal the Core.
```python
# The recurrence relation that distills a number to its essence
essence = nuclear_mutation(ditrune)
```
