# Ternary Elements (The Components of Being)

> *“Three forces that weave the web of existence.”*

## Definition
The IsopGem system operates on a **Balanced Ternary** logic. Unlike binary (which is 0 or 1), ternary logic accepts a third state.

## The Three Elements

### 1. Pyx (The Void)
*   **Symbol**: `0` (or `.` in some notations)
*   **Value**: Neutral (0)
*   **Archetype**: **The Fulcrum**, The Potential, The Silence.
*   **Nature**: It allows space for force to exist. It is the "Unmoved Mover".

### 2. Vertex (The Light)
*   **Symbol**: `1` (or `+` in balanced notation)
*   **Value**: Positive (+1)
*   **Archetype**: **Yang**, Expansion, Projection, Structure.
*   **Nature**: Active force. It pushes outward.

### 3. Nexus (The Shadow)
*   **Symbol**: `2` (or `-` in balanced notation)
*   **Value**: Negative (-1)
*   **Archetype**: **Yin**, Contraction, Reception, Gravity.
*   **Nature**: Receptive force. It pulls inward.

## The Physics of Transition

The interaction between elements is governed by the **Transition Law**:
$$Transition(a, b) = -(a + b) \pmod 3$$

This creates a qualitative alchemy:
*   **Unity of Opposites**: $1 + 2 \rightarrow 0$ (Yang + Yin returns to Void).
*   **Reaction**: $0 + 1 \rightarrow 2$ (Void + Yang triggers Inverse/Yin response).
*   **Stasis**: $0 + 0 \rightarrow 0$ (Void + Void remains Void).

> *"Unlike binary systems that force everything into dualistic oppositions, this ternary approach acknowledges the 'included middle' that creates a more complete representation of reality."*

## Balanced vs. Standard Ternary

Note that while standard ternary uses digits 0, 1, 2, the **Balanced Ternary** system used in TQ logic interprets them as -1, 0, +1.
*   `0` $\rightarrow$ `0`
*   `1` $\rightarrow$ `+1`
*   `2` $\rightarrow$ `-1`
